Title: Virosome: An engineered virus for vaccine delivery

A vaccine is a pharmaceutical technique that tempts an immunologically intervened fight, primarily to an infection, secondarily to other noninfectious diseases (Griffin, 2002, Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997). These are generally prepared of live but attenuated or killed microorganisms or subunits of microorganisms such as genetic materials and antigenic peptides of pathogenic microorganisms. However, subunit vaccines are remarkably selective and very precise in interacting with antibodies, but frequently ineffective to exhibit such reactions in the conditions like a minor change in the epitopic identification center of antibody and are poorly immunogenic (Shi et al., 2005, Liu, 2011, Baghban and Mahmoodi, 2022). Subunits of the causative pathogen microorganism like carbohydrates, proteins, DNA, and RNA, can be explored for generating selective, precise, strong, and prolonged immune reactions (Shi et al., 2005, Liu, 2011, Baghban and Mahmoodi, 2022, Prasad et al., 2011, Praetorius and Mandal, 2007, Fifis et al., 2004).

To tempt immunity effectively, these vaccines need therapeutic potentiation with some factors, called as adjuvants. Generally, adjuvants are supposed to act by forming a complex with antigens to be inoculated, from which immunogens are gradually liberated (Saroja et al., 2011).•Vaccine delivery systems such as emulsions, liposomes, microparticles, immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs,) etc. (Saroja et al., 2011).•Immunostimulatory adjutants: Intact molecular arrays of pathogenic microorganisms instigate immunity, as they are recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) receptors, pattern recognition receptors, found generally on B-cells, dendritic cells (DC) of mammals (e.g., unmethylated CpG containing DNA) (Saroja et al., 2011).

Adjuvants augment the immuno-excitatory properties of antigens but remain non-immunogenic, biodegradable, and nontoxic by themselves (Saroja et al., 2011).

As an innovative technique, simple biologically inactive nanocarriers capable to cater strong protection because of a single dose can be advantageous for various applications (Mohanraj et al., 2010). These nanomaterials can be of natural and synthetic origin. Nanocarriers have equally been employed for the development of vaccines against pathological microorganisms (Champion et al., 2009, Smith et al., 2011). Typically, nanocarriers are the particulate system, whose size ranges from 0.1 nm to 100 nm in diameter (Ozkan, 2004). Numerous types of nanomaterial have been utilized for the manufacture and synthesis of nanovaccines based on natural and synthetic origin. Virus-like particles (VLP), bacterial spores, nanobacteria, bacteriophages, proteosomes, liposomes, exosomes, nanoparticle-based nanobeads, etc. are salient examples of nanocarriers that are explored as promising nanocarriers for vaccine delivery (Champion et al., 2009, Smith et al., 2011, Jain, 2008).

Technology based on shells of viruses that is virosome offers a new smart carrier system to ward off the limitations associated with conventional vaccine delivery systems. Fundamentally, virosomes were manufactured from liposomes by uniting viral envelope proteins that fuse with liposomes (Sharma and Yasir, 2010). Like viruses, virosomes have not the capacity to reproduce but basically, they are pure fusogenic shells (Ludwig and Wagner, 2007). Because of the membrane-fusion and receptor-binding features, virosomal glycoproteins can be conserved, and hence virosomes are used as an active targeting transport carrier for the cellular delivery of therapeutic molecules (Canal et al., 2011). Mitigation and management of infections and active precise immunotherapy for cancers often need the stimulation of an effective immune response, can also be accomplished after utilizing virosome-based delivery vehicles transporting various types of antigens, for instance, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, plasmids, virions, etc. (Kaneda, 2000). A salient characteristic of virosomal carriers is that during the reconstitution of virosomes, several therapeutic agents can be anchored either on the membrane of virosomes or in the hydrophilic interior, like liposomes. Various antigens having small proteins have also been covalently anchored with virosomal envelopes. For this objective, a phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is modified with a conjugator, permitting the covalent conjugation of proteins, most likely through a disulfide bond. However, water-soluble therapeutic agents can be entrapped inside the hydrophilic core of the shell, this can be utilized to deliver the content inside the cell by chimeric virosomes which further improves the high entrapment efficiency of the therapeutic agent with the receptor-mediated engulfment and the fusogenic characteristics of virosomes (Kaneda, 2000, Hug and Sleight, 1994). This novel technique results in about 30 times surge in the quantity of encapsulated water-soluble peptides as compared to the conventional manufacturing methods. Moreover, they can be employed as an appropriate delivery system for RNA and DNA because these fusogenic shells imitate a virus. Also, virosomes exhibit adjuvant features, which is considered as an important property for stimulation of better immune response. The adjuvant nature of virosomes has previously been confirmed by licensed vaccines against influenza viz. Invivac® (Solvay Pharmaceuticals), Inflexal® V (Berna Biotech), and hepatitis A, Epaxal® (Berna Biotech) which possesses the strong immunogenic potential with improved safety and biological properties of a virus-like particle (Hug and Sleight, 1994, Amacker et al., 2005, Cusi, 2006). The present review discusses the basics of virosomes, structure and chemical composition, mechanistic pathway, advantages, their method of preparation, clinical and IPR status comprehensively, and also provides an insight into the potential applications as vaccine carrier and targeting systems using virosomes. Furthermore, the different patents highlighting the applications of virosomes & future prospects of it have also been discussed in the present review.

In context of lipid composition virosomes cater the same adaptability as liposomes, additionally virosomes contain membrane proteins, either derived from the virus itself or produced from recombinant technology (Felnerova et al., 2004). Ultrastructurally, virosomes are unilamellar and spherical reconstituted viral vesicles, which comprises of membrane lipids and viral spike proteins on the surface, however without genetic material, with a mean diameter of about 150 nm (Fig. 1). The exterior of the virosome looks like an intact virus, with peplomer proteins, extended out from the membrane (Bungener et al., 2002, Mischler and Metcalfe, 2002, Bungener et al., 2005). The chief component of virosomes comprises of naturally occurring phospholipids mainly phosphatidylcholine. Only phosphatidylcholine is responsible for about 70% of the structure of the virosomes. The rest 30% of membrane constituents are consists of envelope phospholipids produced from virus, provide haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins (Hug and Sleight, 1994, Amacker et al., 2005, Cusi, 2006, Felnerova et al., 2004, Bungener et al., 2002, Mischler and Metcalfe, 2002, Bungener et al., 2005, Huckriede et al., 2003a). Fundamentally virosomes are, reconstituted hollow virus envelopes, which lacks genetic material, hence, not able to multiply like original pathogenic virus (Ludwig and Wagner, 2007). Unlike liposomes, virosomes comprises of purposeful glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) embedded in the virus membrane (Felnerova et al., 2004, Bungener et al., 2002, Mischler and Metcalfe, 2002, Bungener et al., 2005). Exceptional characteristics of virosomes are partly related to the occurrence of immunologically active HA glycoprotein embedded in their membrane. Haemagglutinin glycoprotein not only ensures the homogeneity and structural stability of virosome but also considerably potentiate the immune-stimulatory properties of virosomal particles, which are obviously different from that of other proteoliposomal and liposomal delivery systems. Fundamentally, HA is consisting of two protein regions those are developed after translational cleavage of HA into two subunits, that is HA1 and HA2, both remain in contact with a disulfide bond (Durrer et al., 1996, Han et al., 2001). The HA1 subunit is consist of a globular head which possesses a receptor binding area that facilitate the attachment of virosomes to various sialic acid residues present on APCs surface (Schoen et al., 1996, Günther-Ausborn et al., 2000). Whereas HA2 subunit has an N-terminal fusion protein and is embedded in the virosomal membrane. At approximately pH 7, HA1 subunit restricts the HA2 subunit in a metastable state though in the inactive condition, where the fusion peptides are controlled by a complex of hydrogen bonds (Hernandez et al., 1996). Conformational transformation of the HA, which exposes out hydrophobic regions of HA2 and instigates the fusion of virosomes with the target cell membrane, after a change in the pH from neutral to acidic. At the time of influenza viral infection, this type of fusion phenomenon happens between the endosomal and viral membranes, which eventually mark in the liberation of the genetic material into the cytoplasm of the target cells. In the in vitro environment, without the presence of target cell, HA is generally deactivated in acidic milieu (about pH 5), at 37 °C temperature, hence, its fusogenicity is no more (Weber et al., 1994). Another glycoprotein found on the virosomal surface, is the NA, an enzyme consisted of four subunits (tetramer) that linked to the membrane hydrophobically, through a stem. The enzymatic loci are present in the subunit head region. Furthermore, the action of NA induces the splitting of NAM (sialic acid) from bound sugar residues (Kim et al., 1999)Fig. 1Electron micrographs of empty virosome (A), and OVA-loaded virosome (B) (Bungener et al., 2002).

The supposed pathway of internalization, intracellular intrusion of virosomes and Ag encapsulated with APC are depicted in Fig. 2. Like the live virus, virosomes bind to sialic acid containing receptors on APCs, for instance, DC (Huckriede et al., 2003b). Subsequently, virosomes with the aid of receptor-facilitated endocytosis, enter into the cell. In endosome, acidic pH stimulates fusion process between virosome and endosomal membrane following the release of encapsulated Ag into the cytosol. Antigen, entrapped in the internal environment of virosomes, can therefore, enter the conventional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I conduit, which is effective in bringing on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses. Nonetheless, all virosomal carriers are unlikely to fuse with the endosomal membrane; some virosomes are unavoidable from endosomal pathway. Finally, Ag-encapsulated virosomes continue their presentation in the endosomal/lysosomal conduit, causing the degradation of the peptides or proteins. The peptides generated are manifested in the milieu of MHC class II molecules. Like the intact parental virus, virosomal carriers transport the entrapped Ag for the appearance in MHC class I and MHC class II, leading to the considerable stimulation of the immune system (Huckriede et al., 2003b, Huckriede et al., 2005, Hayashi et al., 1999, Mizuguchi et al., 1996, Bron et al., 1994, Nakanishi et al., 2000). The subunit A of diphtheria toxin (DTA), a membrane impermeable-macromolecular endotoxin, could be internalized into the cell when DTA was conjugated with virosomes. Because DTA itself cannot enter the cells, it is non-toxic; on the other hand, upon cytosolic liberation assisted by virosomes, DTA is toxic to the cells through the stimulation of elongation factor 2 concerned with protein synthesis in the cell (Mizuguchi et al., 1996, Bron et al., 1994). The bovine serum albumin (BSA) virosomal cellular delivery by the Sendai virus was also established using the confocal laser microscopic technique. BSA labeled with fluorescent dye was encapsulated in liposomes and virosomes. Then these virosomes and liposomes containing fluorescent labeled BSA were pulsed to the EL4 thymoma cells. Only cells treated with virosomes containing labeled BSA showed cytosolic staining, indicating the capacity of virosomes to vomit out the encapsulated contents inside the cells more efficiently (Hayashi et al., 1999, Nakanishi et al., 2000). It has also been studied that the virosomal delivery system is considerably effective in the delivery of ovalbumin (OVA), a reference protein Ag; for MHC class I presentation by murine bone marrow-derived DC. Moreover, virosomes induced a marked expression of co-stimulatory molecules on DC, such as MHC class I, MHC class II, CD40, CD80 (B7-1), and CD86 (B7-2), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) (Bungener et al., 2002). However, it has also been reported that the influenza virosomes cannot trigger the upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules expressed on the surface of plasmacytoid DC (Angel et al., 2007). Basically, plasmacytoid DCs are a distinctive subgroup of DCs specific in secreting of type I interferons in higher concentrations. Moreover, plasmacytoid DCs exhibit an important role in immunogenic action against viral infections; and have found also involved in the onset and development of a number of autoimmune reactions and inflammatory diseases (Ye et al., 2020). This dissimilarity might come from the differences between experimental subject i.e., mouse and human DC. For illustration, mouse DC contain lectin-like receptors, which could sense the HA and NA, protein spikes, presenting on the virosomal surface (Cambi and Figdor, 2003). Till now, the upregulation of immunostimulatory signals activated by virosomes is not yet well explained. The virosomes synthesized from the native viruses, thus, might have the capacity to upregulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, which are needed to prime T cells. To efficiently prime specific T cells, the costimulatory molecules expression on DC and the secretion of Th1 (helper T cells Type 1) polarizing cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFNγ) or IL-12 are fundamental phenomenon in the triggering of T cells mediated immunity (Trombetta and Mellman, 2005, Banchereau and Steinman, 1998).Fig. 2Diagrammatic representation of the interplay of virosomes with the immune system (Huckriede et al., 2003b).

Cuzi et al. have investigated the possibility of enhancing the immunogenicity of a plasmid DNA encoding carcinoembryonic Ag (CEA) by co-encapsulation of plasmid expressing CD40L, a protein that is primarily expressed on activated T cells and is a member of the TNF superfamily of molecules, in influenza virosomes (Cusi et al., 2005). It is hypothesized that CD40L expression by transfected DC would interact with the CD40 on DC, which eventually enhances the specific T-cell priming ability. Bioconjugation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR2 and TLR4 ligand, into the lipid-bilayer of virosomes was a potent drive for murine B lymphocytes, which was 10 times more active than the free LPS (Dijkstra et al., 1996). This could offer an effective and new strategic platform for tumor immunotherapy. Though influenza virosomes signify a constructive vaccine delivery system for CTL initiation, there is a viewpoint that immunity induced against the influenza virus after subbing clinical infections or vaccination might impede the immunity-stimulating effect of influenza virosomes. Though, antibody-dependent increase the neutralization of influenza A virus by the cells possessing Fc receptor was assessed by employing three immunogenic strains of influenza A virus viz. H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. Sera acquired from the mice after the primary infestation of influenza virus strains viz. H1N1, H2N2, or H3N2, neutralized the virus of the same strain as well as sera enhanced the uptake of the virus across the strain. Sera obtained from H1N1 strain-infested animals increased the neutralization of the homologous strain that is H1N1 as well as H2N2 (heterologous) strain. Remarkably, sera obtained from mice after the immunization with H2N2 strain increased the neutralization of all virus strains (H1N1, H2N2, or H3N2). Furthermore, sera obtained from the H3N2 infected mice enhanced the neutralization of the H3N2 (homologous) as well as H2N2 (heterologous) viruses. These outcomes suggested that strain cross-reactive, antibodies enhanced the neutralization of different strains of the influenza A virus. Antibodies to NA may cause the improved neutralization of viruses of a varied strain. N2-specific monoclonal antibodies enhanced the neutralization of both H2N2 and H3N2 strains of influenza virus (Tamura et al., 1994). This implies that antibodies that bind to the influenza virus increase the neutralization of the virus via Fc-receptor by APCs. Zurbriggen and Gluck have also demonstrated that mice and rabbits, pre-immunized with the influenza virus, enhanced the induction of immunogenicity against peptide antigen linked to the influenza virus (Zurbriggen and Gluck, 1999).

Virosome contains many properties of nanoparticulate vaccine and drug delivery technology. Virosomes encompass the benefits of liposomes and polymeric nanoparticle systems and additionally overcoming the time-based and in vivo instability issues that is associated with the conventional as well as polymeric nanoparticles vaccine delivery approaches. However, virosomes have more analogy with respect to structure, composition, and formulation properties with liposomes (Kaneda, 2000). This particulate system has some special features and advantages over other vaccine delivery systems.•virosomal carriers are biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic, and hence safe (Huckriede et al., 2005).•immunopotentiation, because of cellular internalization and the long circulatory effect (Huckriede et al., 2003a).•applicable with almost all key therapeutic categories of drugs like peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, anticancer drugs (Felnerova et al., 2004).•allows delivery of therapeutic molecules inside the target cell (Bungener et al., 2006).•efficient targeting of tumor (Felnerova et al., 2004, Angel et al., 2007, Bungener et al., 2006).•no autoimmunogenicity or anaphylaxis (Glück et al., 1994).•encourages fusogenic activity in the endosomal pathway (Arkema et al., 2000).•industrial scale up-ability (Leroux-Roels et al., 2013).

Biological products in common and vaccines in specific are highly complex, potent, and environment sensitive products. The important task is to establish a smooth, sturdy, economical and precise manufacturing process which can produce a specifically defined nanoparticle, multi-components structure for clinical use of virosome. The structure and composition of virosomes and liposomes is fundamentally identical. Both virosomes and liposomes are constructed of a phospholipid bilayer resulting in a sac-like structure, in which a core can be employed for delivering a drug molecule, peptide, protein, nucleic acid etc. to the target tissues. A fundamental issue related to the liposomal carrier is their speedy clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Krishnamachari et al., 2011). Numerous alterations have been proposed by the scientific community to cope-up with these practical problems, important one is the making a film of PEGs on the surface of liposomes, which can assist the liposomal carriers to work as a stealth carrier, thus, avoiding clearance by RES and hence prolonging the circulation time (Babar et al., 2013). As it is evident that each component of the virosomal delivery system is synthesized separately and then subsequently assembled into virosomes (Felnerova et al., 2004). For this purpose, high-quality antibody response recombinant proteins, peptides, and other components are obtained from GMP-certified suppliers. Because neutralized virus employed for virosomal carrier preparation is the similar substance which is utilized for the marketed preparation of influenza vaccine. Commercially, it can be procured from influenza virus vaccine producers. Even today, almost all virosomal carriers-based vaccines tried in human subjects were manufactured with influenza virus cultured in embryonated chicken eggs (Widjaja et al., 2006). Though, virus developed on cell culture has been established equally useful for the development of virosomal carriers (Geerligs et al., 2008). Reconstitution of envelopes of virus generally relies on solubilization of the viral envelopes with non-denaturing detergents such as Triton X-100 and Octaethylene glycol mono (n-dodecyl) ether (C12E8) followed by removal of viral nucleocapsid complexes (Huckriede et al., 2003b, Nunes-Correia et al., 2002). After solubilization of virus envelope, inherent genetic material of the virus is separated out by ultracentrifugation technique. Virus membrane is reconstituted after the self-assembling phenomenon of a fragmented viral membrane composed of phospholipids and other transmembrane glycoproteins. As a result, these virosomes are then separated out from un-entrapped Ag by discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (Huckriede et al., 2003b).

Other procedures for virosomal carrier production have also been discussed. For example, virosomes produced as per the procedure of Berna Biotech are termed “immunopotentiating reconstituted influenza virosomes (IRIV)” (Felnerova et al., 2004, Huckriede et al., 2005). IRIV are prepared by the detergent solubilization technique as mentioned above, but with the addition of external phospholipids, reassembled when C12E8 is either separated by dialysis or adsorption onto a hydrophobic resin (Stegmann et al., 1987). The antigen of interest such as DNA, RNA or plasmid is coupled to lipid anchor. Lipids encompass phospholipids and cholesterol, phospholipids for instance, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, dioleyldimethylammonium chloride (DODAC), dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) etc. Antigen coupled with lipid load on virosomes and certain antibodies such as mAbs can also be anchored to it that bind to the surface proteins (epitopes) of specific type of cells (Bhattacharya and Mazumder, 2011). After the addition of external phospholipids, a higher Ag encapsulation and homogeneous virosome particles can be obtained (Kushnir et al., 2012). However, these IRIV would have lower membrane glycoprotein densities because of the excess lipids added during reconstitution. As a result, virosomes with excess phospholipids added might result in a decreasing in cell binding and fusion activity of virosomes.

Another approach for preparing virosomal vaccine delivery system has been proposed via fusing simple lipid vesicles (liposomes) containing antigen with ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated Sendai virus particles (Stegmann et al., 1987, Kushnir et al., 2012). In contrast to the influenza virosomes these virosomal carriers are prepared according to the method discussed above, contain the viral RNA. General manufacturing method can be employed to antigens such as recombinant protein, pathogen derived proteins, synthetic peptides, or carbohydrates. Batch processing step is followed in the production of immunological products. After extraction, the viral antigens are mixed with phospholipids and detergent. Afterwards the product obtained, was allowed to pass through different decontamination and sterilization steps. Generally, the virosomal formulation is dispersed in a buffered normal saline solution to get stable and safe final product (Carmona-Ribeiro, 2010, Tofoli et al., 2011). These purification and formulation steps make the virosome stable, safe, and effective for use. The production procedure of virosomal carrier is established at industrial scale with GMP specifications, as established by the continuous production of Epaxal® and Inflexal ® V. The in vitro self-assembly of the virosomal carrier is accomplished at higher concentration and therefore, in a small volume, thus allowing for large scale production of up to 500,000 doses per run even in small facilities (Leroux-Roels et al., 2013).

For characterization of the virosomal formulation, simple qualitative tests are carried out that are explicitly intended for viral proteins. Methods of analysis based on electron microscopy, generally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can be employed for the evaluation of the precise shape, texture, size, and structure of the virosomes. Characteristic evaluation of virosomes depends on the property of the material to be tested. Viral proteins are evaluated by comparatively versatile and straightforward procedures like sodium dodecyl sulphate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Virosomes’ fusogenic activity can be estimated employing the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) method (Deniger et al., 2006, Moser et al., 2003, Bungener et al., 2002).

Generally, the influenza virus come into the cells via endocytotic mechanism arbitrated by the binding of sialic acid and HA1, consequently, HA2 get fused with the cell. Typically, traditional approaches for the manufacture of virosomes are based on influenza virus, which generally do not claim the membrane fusion features of influenza viruses, completely. Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), a novel protein expression technique, offers a practically feasible approach for the protein’s synthesis for virosomes. Generally, this technique does not require the involvement of surfactants, hence it hardly damages the functional structure of the proteins. Additionally, this technique also encompasses easy manufacturing methods. Interestingly, it is a one-step process where two phenomena i.e., protein synthesis and membrane integration are taking place simultaneously (Fig. 3) (Wang et al., 2022). The manufacturing method is briefly illustrated in
Fig. 4.Fig. 3Diagrammatic illustration of cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) (Wang et al., 2022).Fig. 4Flow chart of process of synthesis of virosome using cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system.

Konstanins et al. effectively produced a peptide along with a linking agent, cytoplasmic tail (HA-TMR-CT), an α-helical secondary structure, and transmembrane region using the CFPS method of virosome production with enhanced yield (Mineev et al., 2013). HA2 virosomes were produced by employing a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, study exhibited a pH-dependent fusogenic activity of the HA2 virosomes and showed an outstanding activity to deliver siRNA. MS2 bacteriophage coat protein by Escherichia coli cell-free protein was synthesized fruitfully (Bundy et al., 2008). After recognition, the MS2 bacteriophage protein helps the exogenous RNA to encapsulate (Stockley et al., 1994). It has also been studied that the synthesis of virus-like particles (VLPs) as a carrier for exogenous RNA by employing MS2 bacteriophage protein (Pan et al., 2012;
Wei et al., 2009;
Sun et al.,2011). MS2 bacteriophage protein has also been used in the CFPS to synthesize virosomes as a siRNA carrier. A virus glycoprotein 64 (Gp64), is a protein expressed over the Baculovirus envelope with the capacity of CFPS and siRNA delivery. It has been studied that Gp64 exhibit a pH reliant membrane fusion feature, which was comparable to HA2. Gp64 induced membrane fusion was observed at acidic pH, generally less than 5.5 (Blissard and Wenz, 1992). A glycoprotein, F, attributed to Sendai virus also exhibit the virosomes production by cell-free protein synthesis. Fusion (F) protein and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) are the two glycoproteins which are found on the virus envelope of Sendai virus (Bagai and Sarkar, 1993). Interestingly, glycoprotein, F, take part in the fusion process of Sendai virus with membrane of the target cell. However, scientists precisely isolated F and HN glycoprotein and investigated the role of F glycoprotein in the membrane fusion of the target cell and proved that whole F-glycoprotein is essential for this process (Mizuguchi et al., 1999). Furthermore, it was studied that virosomal carriers produced by incorporating F- glycoprotein into the phospholipids showed the capacity to instigate fusogenic property and gene delivery potential (Verma et al., 2005).

Therefore, as compared to the conventional method of virosome synthesis, the CFPS method could warrant the accurate folding and precise alignment of the peptides implicated in the synthesis of virosomes and the functional and structural intactness of virosomes, which could be emphasized for future research. Furthermore, because of its noteworthy merits over traditional virosomes manufacturing method, CFPS, as a novel technology for the manufacturing of virosomes, will certainly encourage new progress in virosomal technology, which will eventually serve as a cutting-edge nano-carrier technology to surmount the existing challenges in immunotherapy and gene delivery.

Generally, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are accountable for the neutralization of virus-infested cells and therefore are responsible for the mitigation and cure from the viral infections (Stevenson and Doherty, 1998). CTLs specific to the influenza virus are primarily triggered by epitopes originating from proteins present inside the virus, for instance, matrix proteins and the nucleoproteins, in humans, whereas immunodominant epitopes are manifested mainly on the nucleoprotein, in mice (Parker and Gould, 1996). Though, physiologically significant CTL activity may be induced by other viral antigens like haemagglutinin. Generally, immunization with traditional vaccine does not induce substantial CTL activity, hence these vaccines are not better option as a carrier of antigens to the APC. Generally, subunit vaccines do not possess the significant CTL antigens, for instance, nucleoprotein and matrix protein. In this way, virosomal carriers unclutch the opportunity to deliver antigens across the cell membrane, that is direct to the cytosol for antigen presentation on MHC class I system and therefore may improve CTL activity with augmentation of antibody responses. Helper-T cells are of critical significance, specifically for triggering the activity of B cell. Helper-T cells are also important for the development of B cells and antibody class changing (Baumgarth, 2000). Furthermore, helper-T cells augment the cytokine production, where CTLs can develop. Therefore, vaccines must be capable of tempting strong helper-T cell reactions, a matter that is frequently ignored. Influenza infection characteristically tempts the helper-T cells mediated immune reaction which is described by the secretion of IFNγ as the main cytokine. Such type of helper-T cell reaction encourages the biosynthesis of antibodies of IgG2a in mice and IgG1 subclass in humans, and stimulates the CTLs development (Stevenson and Doherty, 1998).

As a proof of concept, the virosomal carriers with an anchored peptide are found to conform a well-recognized CTL-specific nucleoprotein epitope, which can further improve the nucleoprotein-specific CTL reaction. It was investigated that mice vaccinated with the peptide-anchored virosomal carriers twice (with the 2-week interval), from the intraperitoneal route of administration were found to exhibit augmented CTL reactions against the peptide. Even a small amount, as low as 0.5 μg of virosome entrapped peptide was adequate to instigate a strong immune response like an intact infectious influenza virus. However, vaccination with even higher amount, as high as 100 μg of free peptide did not exhibit CTL stimulation. Fusion process of the virosomal carrier was vital for the instigation of the immune reaction because fusion-disabled virosomal carrier were unsuccessful to produce a considerable CTL response (Arkema et al., 2000). It was observed in vitro that virosomal carriers are proficient the in delivery of ovalbumin (OVA) prototype antigen into the DC, thus tempting MHC class I antigen presentation of ovalbumin. It has also been studied in vivo that virosomal carriers are proficient in prompting OVA-induced CTL responses (Bungener et al., 2005). Mice were vaccinated two times with an interval of a fortnight with 2.5 μg of OVA in virosomal carriers through different vaccination routes. After a week of booster dose, OVA induced CTL activity was studied in the vaccinated mice spleen cells by utilizing OVA specific target cells in a Chromium-51 (51Cr)-release assay. This assay is generally employed for the specific and precise estimation of cytotoxicity of NK cell and CTLs (Karimi et al., 2014). Employing MHC tetramer staining and IFNγ, effector cell populace triggered by vaccination of mice with OVA-containing virosomal carriers were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay. These findings exhibited that vaccination of mice with virosomal carriers having OVA proficiently primes and triggers CD8 + T cells that are involved against the Kb-bound OVA epitope SIINFEKL, a well characterized protein. These cells show the capacity to lyse the target cells presenting the OVA peptide exhibit the potential of producing IFNγ. It was postulated that virosomal carrier arbitrated CTL stimulation is fundamentally based on the transport of antigen encapsulated virosomal carriers into APC. To get new insights into the mechanistic pathway of virosomal carriers facilitated priming of CTL activity, mice were vaccinated with fusion active and fusion inactive OVA-containing virosomes. It was observed that OVA specific CTL stimulation was more in the mice, immunized with fusion active OVA virosomes as compared to the one which is vaccinated with fusion inactive virosomes. Fusion inactivation of OVA virosomes caused a reduction in CTL activity to about half. Therefore, fusion activity of the virosomes in vivo is not crucial for stimulation of a CTL response, however, evidently useful for optimal CTL priming. The capacity of fusion inactive virosomal carriers to carry antigens for MHC class I presentation, is because of the escape of exogenous antigen from the APC endosomes, following the presentation of antigenic peptides by MHC class I molecules. These outcomes suggest that virosomal carriers are potential agents for CTL-inducing vaccines because of their capacity to carry entrapped antigens, in vivo, across the cell membrane to the cytosol of APC (Huckriede et al., 2005).

Helper-T cells responses of subunit and virosome-based influenza vaccines were studied after the vaccination of mice. After intramuscular administration, both vaccines tempted influenza specific helper-T cells. After the instigation of immunity with influenza antigen, CTL acquired from the spleen of immunized mice yields IFNγ and IL-4 showing that immunization tepmted a balanced response (type 1 helper T cells vs type 2 helper T cells). Though, IFNγ yielding cells were considerably increased in number in the mice, immunized with virosomal vaccine in comparison with the mice vaccinated with the subunit vaccine (Huckriede et al., 2005). These findings suggest that the viral antigens presentation has a deep impact on the magnitude of immune response. As compared to the subunit vaccines, the helper-T cell response instigated by virosomal vaccines were more resemble to that witnessed after the infectious viruses.

Over the last twenty years, a substantial number of clinical involvements of immunization with influenza vaccine in general, and influenza virosomes has been gathered. Epaxal®, hepatitis A vaccine developed by Crucell was the first approved vaccine based on virosomes, for commercial applications (Ambrosch et al., 1997). In brief, Epaxal® was composed of pathologically inactivated hepatitis A virus adsorbed onto the surface of already made influenza virosome (Glück and Wälti, 2000). As compared to alum-adjuvanted products, hepatitis A virus vaccines based on virosomes attributed at almost equal immunogenicity, a substantial local tolerance, and the creation of long-term memory based on B cell was exhibited by various clinical studies (Bovier, 2008a, Bovier, 2008b, Hatz et al., 2011).

Fundamentally, influenza vaccines are homologous to the influenza virosomes, wherein virus envelope proteins behave as the antigen of interest. Implementation of influenza virosomes as an antigen carrier, the immunogenic effects such as expanded CD4 and Helper-T lymphocytes associated with the presence of influenza envelope proteins, are not considered as added adjuvant characteristics as they are closely associated with the antigen. A definite particle construction and the enhanced phospholipid amount differentiates influenza vaccines based on virosomal carriers from orthodox subunit vaccines. But, as compared to the adjuvanted vaccines of influenza-like FluAd®, and Inflexal® V, a virosomal vaccine does not carry any other supplementary immuno-stimulatory constituents. Inflexal® V is the only adjuvanted vaccine of influenza, which is useful for all age groups and exhibits a notable immune response in immunocompromised and healthy children, adults, and the elderly (Herzog et al., 2009). Nasal Flu, an influenza vaccine, administered through the intranasal route, contained the identical virosomes as Inflexal® V, additionally, it is adjuvanted with E. coli (mucosal adjuvant). After the increased occurrences of Bell’s palsy in immunized individuals, it was withdrawn soon after the launch (Mutsch et al., 2004). Probably these adverse events were produced by the heat-labile toxins (HLT), which was then established by identical observations in the clinical trials with the non-virosomal influenza vaccines adjuvanted with HLT, administered intranasally (Mutsch et al., 2004, Lewis et al., 2009). Invivac®, a virosome-based trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine for i.m. administration, was launched in 2004 by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, remains commercially accessible in the market for one season only (de Bruijn et al., 2007, de Bruijn et al., 2004, de Bruijn et al., 2006).

Virosomal carriers present an innovative and well-known, drug carrier system. Various virosomal products are presently available commercially to achieve the therapeutic, diagnostic, and prophylactic purposes. Virosomal vaccines can serve the purpose of immunization products by actively prompting an immune reaction. Correspondingly, they could be good candidates as an adjuvant. Owning the ability to deliver macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids etc, virosomal carriers are perfect device to act as drug carrier systems. Virosomal drug carrier systems exhibit good pharmacokinetic properties, guaranteeing the effective and safe way to explore the therapeutic potential of a drug. The fusion capacity of the virosomal carriers differs with the amount of viral surface proteins. Furthermore, the batch processing and complex assay techniques are some limitations of virosomes. Therefore, efforts are required to be made in this setting to develop simple and easy assay methods. Addressing these concerns and troubleshooting them will guarantee the approval and availability of a greater number of biopharmaceuticals based on virosomes (Mutsch et al., 2004, Lewis et al., 2009, de Bruijn et al., 2007, de Bruijn et al., 2004, de Bruijn et al., 2006).

A synthetic peptide (derived from Plasmodium falciparum) based vaccine of malaria was tested clinically. A clinical trial Phase I study with healthy children and adult subjects demonstrated a high degree of immunogenicity, excellent tolerability, and good safety. But in Phase II trial, a tardy and morphologically atypical parasite growth was observed (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

A hepatitis C vaccine based on three peptides among which two peptides representing CTL epitopes, are entrapped in virosome, and the third peptide acting as a CD4 epitope are attached on the surface of virosome. It was formulated as a therapeutically active T-cell vaccine in order to treat chronic hepatitis C viral infections. Though, the vaccine was unsuccessful to trigger the expected T-cell response in the healthy subjects in the clinical trial (Phase I) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

An intramuscular and intravaginal freeze-dried virosomal vaccine with membrane-attached recombinant Secreted aspartic peptidases (rtSap2) was synthesized for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal Candidiasis. It is exhibited by a membrane attached rtSap2, enzymatically inactive, recombinant, and an abridged form of the secreted protease Sap2. Fundamentally, Sap2 is an acidic hydrolases enzyme responsible for virulence factor in Candida. This enzyme help to provide the fungus with amino acids and able to degrade some selected host's proteins implicated in the immune response and induces host inflammatory cytokine synthesis. In a Phase I study both application routes were studied independently in healthy subjects. Intravaginal as well as intramuscular applications were reported safe, nontoxic, and hence well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022, Schaller et al., 2003).

A target authenticated (established by Trastuzumab), a trivalent vaccine was designed to trigger the production of antibodies targeting the Her2/neu receptor, for the management of breast cancer. This vaccine is incorporated with three peptides derived from Her2/neu that were attached to the influenza virosomal surface (Wiedermann et al., 2010).

Clinical studies, types, and their status related to vaccine delivery through virosomes.

Because of the various pros and cons of non-virus and virus-based carriers, the notion of carrying siRNA employing a virosome delivery system has been studied in a pre-clinical setting. The virosomal carrier system with the prospects of siRNA delivery encompassing, different types of virus proteins employed to synthesize virosomes. The cell-free protein synthesis method could be a potential platform for the delivery of siRNA through virosomal drug carriers (Huckriede et al., 2007).

Despite a number of advances in the area of immunization and vaccines, there is still a technological gap and challenges to develop a novel and effective for the treatment of ailments like AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Moreover, some of the currently available immunization products have limitations like the inability to completely instigate the immune response, in vivo intactness issues, systemic toxicity, frequented dosing, and in vitro stability and preservation challenges. To troubleshoot the abovementioned problems nanotechnology has emerged as an important tool. Commonly, nanovaccine system is a novel type of vaccine employing nanoparticles (NPs) as a carrier system and as an adjuvant. Because the NPs and immunogens are of almost similar size, hence, the immune response can be induced considerably, resulting in a better outcome. Hence, nanovaccines encompass in vivo intactness, better immunity instigation, chances of frequented and booster dosing are rare, better in vitro stability, and the ability to target actively (Hayat et al., 2019). Some recently approved marketed nanovaccine products are discussed in Table 2.Table 2Clinically tested and recently approved COVID-19 nano-vaccines for human use.Pay-LoadBrand NameMarketed ByYear of approvalReferencesNucleoside-modified mRNASpikevaxPfizer-BioNTech2022(USFDA, 2022)BNT162b2 [mRNA]ComirnatyBioNTech-Pfzer2021(Lamb, 2021)Recombinant incompetent Ad26 vectorJanssen COVID-19 VaccineJohnson & Johnson2020(Sa et al., 2022)Adenovirus serotypes 5 and 26Sputnik VGamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia2021(Mikule et al., 2021)Recombinant human adenovirus 26 serotypeSputnik LightGamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia2021(Tukhvatulin etal., 2021)

Presently available influenza vaccines on the market are effective and safe for treatment of influenza. However, there is still a requirement for influenza vaccines with better efficacy, in general and for geriatric patients. Currently, several techniques are being evolved so as to increase the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccines in geriatric patients and the patient population who exhibit weakened immune reactions to orthodox influenza vaccines. A well-known general characteristic, which was frequently established for the approved formulations, of all virosomal vaccines is their good tolerability (Herzog et al., 2009, Bovier, 2008b). No fatality was observed throughout the study. Four severe adverse effects viz. sepsis, arthralgia, psoas abscess, and joint abscess, were experienced by one volunteer, all effects were viewed as unrelated to the vaccine in question, and the volunteer was fully recovered. The percentage of volunteers who complain for at least one treatment-emergent adverse events were, 8.5%, 6.3%, and 13.8% with Influvac®, Invivac® and Fluad®, respectively. The most frequented treatment-emergent adverse events were, injection site-related erythema with Influvac (none) Invivac® (0.8%), Fluad® (2.3%); and arthralgia with Influvac® (1.6%), Invivac® (0.8%), Fluad® (0.8%). Fluad® related reactions were lasted in 3 days, while Influvac® and Invivac® showed the reactions for 1–2 days (Bruijn et al., 2006).

In elderly patients, virosome-based influenza vaccines like Invivac®, are as effective as orthodox influenza vaccine like Influvac® or to the adjuvanted vaccine e.g., Fluad® in context of the immunostimulatory effect of the HA of the three viral strains contained in the vaccines. Ideally, vaccines must meet for immunogenicity criteria in geriatric patients prescribed by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), for all three strains. It was found that Invivac® was well tolerated and safe in geriatric patients. The tolerability and safety of Invivac® was comparable to the Influvac® standard influenza vaccine. Individuals immunized with the Fluad®, an adjuvanted influenza vaccine, exhibit considerably more local reactions per individual than individuals immunized with Invivac® or Influvac®. However, local reactions after immunization with Fluad® persist longer as compared to Influvac® and Invivac®. Conclusively, Invivac® exhibit a comparable immunogenicity to the adjuvanted as well as standard influenza vaccine to the geriatric subjects and exhibit a better tolerability in comparison with Fluad® an adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Herzog et al., 2009, Bovier, 2008a, Bovier, 2008b, de Bruijn et al., 2006).

Several inventions related to virosomes are protected by IPR. Patents related to virosomes cover several aspects, like their application as a vaccine delivery vehicle or drug carrier system, production process, unit operations involved in the production of virosomes like freeze drying, combination with other adjuvants etc. Including the patents covering various technical and industrial aspects protecting the next-generation virosomal carriers and applications of virosomes not yet approved at the industry scale. Virosomal know-how was protected by a patent, given to Berna Biotech (Crucell), apply for an IRIV in combination with an antigen. Fundamentally, this patent comprises of the three virosome-based products viz. Epaxal®, Epaxal® Junior and Inflexal® V. As far as the number of patents of virosome-based technology are concerned, Pevion Biotech AG and Mymetics B.V. are the main assignees (Cusi et al., 2003). Many patents related to virosomal technology are assigned to the companies such as Novartis, Switzerland, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), United Kingdom. Another method of production of virosomes was patented, which is fundamentally based on the method of solubilization of the virus envelope composed of a short-chain phospholipid, was established by Mymetics BV in partnership with the University of Groningen (Luise et al., 2011). An immunopotentiating reconstituted influenza virosome (IRIV) consists of cationic cholesterol inserted in the phospholipid membrane was found to be appropriate for the freeze drying and its reconstitution was assigned to Pevion Bitech Limited. This technique permits thermostable virosome-based vaccines with prolonged shelf-life (Zurbriggen et al., 2013a). Conventionally, influenza vaccines were prepared in chicken eggs. Though, the process based on cell-lines could be rapid, more reproducible, and versatile in context of virus propagation and also permits and ease the propagation of various strains that cannot be efficiently cultured in egg yolks. Remarkably, virosomes produced from influenza virus propagated in avian cell lines exhibited an improved immunogenicity and better fusion activity as compared to virosomes reconstituted from influenza viruses manufactured by the conventional methods employing chicken eggs (Zurbriggen et al., 2013b). Exploring other sources for the influenza virus envelope proteins and accurately defined compositions of virosomes, patent application shows that completely synthetic virosome based on recombinant HA may be attractive in the future (Di Naro, 2012). Several patents related to disease are filed and granted. An alphavirus HIV vaccine for the mitigation and prevention of AIDS was developed with the help of a joint venture of the University of North Carolina and AlphaVax Inc (Olmstedet al., 2004). Janssen Vaccines AG, developed a reconstituted influenza virosomes-based immunopotentiating Hepatitis A virus vaccine (Glick and Mischler 1996). Another patent was granted to Pevion Biotech for the successful development of an immunopotentiating vaccine against HIV (Fleury et al., 2015). The GSK Biologicals was assigned a patent for an influenza virosome, fundamentally, the invention was related to the composition and structure of a virosome having influenza virus or RSV antigen, along with a saponin, as an adjuvant (Coller et al., 2015). Another patent was assigned to the SmithKline Beecham Corp for the preparation of immunogenic influenza virosomes having a variety of microvesicles (Almeida and Edwards, 1980). Moreover, Janssen Vaccines AG successfully produced a hybrid, membranous vesicle containing at least one lipid and enveloped proteins of influenza and hepatitis B virus (Moser et al., 2011). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccine was developed and its production technique was invented at Chongqing University (Fenglin et al., 2011). A novel cationic virosome for the effective delivery of nucleic acids to the resting as well as multiplying human cells for the treatment of cancer was invented by Nika Health Products Ltd (Walti et al., 2001). An HIV virosome with novel immunogenic compositions was fabricated eliciting good immunogenicity by Emory University in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. (Compans et al., 2010). University of North Carolina, AlphaVax Inc., and University of Cape Town were granted a patent for the development of HIV-1 virosome based vaccine, which offered a new technique for the selection of HIV-1 (clade) C isolates, for the treatment and prophylaxis purpose (Johnston et al., 2007). A patent revealing a successful development of respiratory syncytial virosome was granted to the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China (Zheng et al., 2011).

Summary of some useful patents filed for delivery of virus vaccines through virosomes.

Virosomal carrier system has not yet been comprehensively explored. The present gene delivery carriers have been extensively studied, recently from various clinical trials promising developments for viral delivery systems have been reported. Over the last few years, it has been comprehended that the advancements of a versatile gene delivery carrier are possibly to be misleading. Diseases that are treatable by the use of gene therapy are quite different and hence need personalized approaches of treatments. The management of some illnesses need an ample but transient protein expression, while other illnesses may only be cured by a regulated expression, generally, stoppage of expression of a particular gene for longer duration. In certain conditions, multiple or single genes must be presented into the nucleus of the target cell, whereas in other conditions cytoplasmic delivery of siRNA is enough. Furthermore, the type of the diseased cells like the mitotic and endocytic environment and the locale of the cells in the body play an important role to treat the disease. These different characteristics appeal for the development of delivery devices of nucleic that are customized for a specific purpose. Hence, it is of paramount significance that various types of delivery carriers become available prospectively, viral, or non-viral origin or hybrids of these. Complications associated with DNA-virosomal carriers can be resolved, the virosomal drug carrier platform embodies the technology platform that can be effortlessly attuned to fulfill the need for the treatment of a particular disease and hence a significant involvement in the available resource of nucleic acid and monoclonal antibodies delivery in the future. Vaccination is the one of the most effective way for the treatment and prevention of infectious disease. Recently, a number of nanovaccines based virosomal formulations have been marketed against prevalent and life-threatening infections. To date severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are effective, but long-term protection is vulnerable to the occurrence of new virus variant. Currently, tremendous efforts were made to synthesize a virosome-based vaccine delivery system against a novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Still, some untiring efforts are required to successfully prepare a robust safe, effective and reproducible virosome-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in clinical situation. Virosomes embody as novel drug carrier system for the delivery of various biologically active molecules but some aspects of virosomal drug delivery system such as IVIVC, stability, tolerability, optimization, scale-up are still topics to be discussed in detail.

Conclusively, virosome embodies reconstituted virus envelope, excluding the nucleic acid of the native virus. As compared to the liposome, virosome possesses functionally active virus phospholipid membranous structure along with associated spike proteins and peptides intercalated in the envelope. The clinically established features of virosome as antigen carrier as well as adjuvant have endorsed the progress and advancement in virosome-based vaccines having varied and new antigens. Although, possessing a simple structure, and easy fabrication methods, the activity of the product is dependent on the antigen and the costs associated with production, might prevent the broader applications of virosome for cost effective common preventative immunization products such as tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B, etc. Hence, due to increasing attention on alum-free antigenic immunization products virosomes are gaining significant consideration.
