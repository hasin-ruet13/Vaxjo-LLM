Title: Therapeutic Immunomodulation of Tumor-Lymphatic Crosstalk
via Intratumoral Immunotherapy

Sentinel lymph node (SLN)
status has been a mainstay of clinical
cancer diagnoses and prognoses for the better part of a century; only
more recently have the numerous regulatory roles that the crosstalk
between the tumor microenvironment and the lymphatic system play in
disease progression come into focus.1−3 These roles include not
only providing a pathway for spread of disease from regional to systemic
but also developing an antitumor adaptive immune response, facilitated
by peritumoral lymphatics, locally as well as in tumor-draining lymph
nodes (TDLNs), that is necessary for tumor immune surveillance and
elimination.1,4,5 Critically,
these TDLNs are sites where systemically active immune responses can
be modulated. Tumors can also coopt immune regulatory pathways to
modulate immune activity in the TDLN and peritumoral lymphatics in
order to evade immune surveillance and destruction.6 These immune regulatory effects are important factors limiting
the effects of cancer immunotherapies. The transformative success
of immunotherapies in the past decade thus stands to further benefit
from expanding targets to include those implicated in tumor-lymphatic
immune crosstalk.7−9

The clinical advances in cancer immunotherapy
have been accompanied
by an explosion of preclinical and clinical investigations into new
immunotherapeutic modalities and targets. Yet most immunotherapies
currently in clinical use continue to be administered systemically,
despite the nature of the adaptive immune system allowing localized
immune education that yields systemic immunity. Systemically administered
therapies have relatively poor access to the tumor. Even purportedly
tumor-targeting antibodies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
see less than 1% of the administered dose reach the tumor following
intravenous injection.10,11 Access to peritumoral lymphatics,
SLNs, and TDLNs from systemic administration is even poorer, making
it easy to understand how therapeutic immunomodulation within the
regional lymphatic bed of solid tumors has long been overlooked. A
potential solution to improving the accumulation of therapeutic payload
in both tumors and their lymphatic basins is suggested by a commonly
used diagnostic technique: SLN mapping is routinely achieved by intratumoral
or peritumoral injection of contrast agent. Treating solid tumors
regionally can allow high levels of drug delivery to tumors and TDLNs
as an alternative to systemic administration. In the context of immunotherapy,
such approaches could modulate both local immunity (in the tumor)
and systemic immunity (via the TDLNs), not only controlling the treated
tumor but also generating systemic control of disease despite the
treatment being regionally applied. Indeed, such a therapeutic strategy
may be key to overcoming the historical failure of intratumoral therapy
in adequately treating distant metastases.

Developments in diagnostic
techniques and treatment protocols in
recent years increasingly fortify the relevance of peritumoral lymphatics
and the SLN as therapeutic targets. For example, lymphatic mapping,
which uses a tracer to identify the LN(s) draining a tumor basin,
is an ever more widely used diagnostic tool that could also plausibly
enable deliberate therapeutic targeting of the SLN. Complete LN dissection
(CLND), which is the preemptive surgical removal of all LNs locoregional
to an identified tumor, has dramatically decreased in prevalence due
to mounting evidence that routine CLND does not benefit most patients.
For example, randomized phase 3 clinical trials in melanoma have indicated
no difference in survival for patients with SLN metastasis who receive
CLND compared to observation.12,13 Similarly, despite
its potential diagnostic value, even routine SLN biopsy (SLNB) has
not resulted in significantly improved disease-specific survival versus
observation in melanoma or breast cancer.14−16 As such, debate
continues over whether LN metastasis occurs in advance or concurrently
with systemic metastasis. Thus, now and looking to the future, more
LNs are being left in patients post diagnosis, offering unique, heretofore
untapped opportunities for immunomodulation.

In parallel to
changes in clinical practices around LN management/removal,
treatment paradigms have changed (Figure 1).17 The early
as well as more recent immunotherapies were all first approved in
the adjuvant setting (given after tumor resection/main treatment).
However, immunotherapies have been increasingly shown to demonstrate
even greater potency in the neoadjuvant setting (given before tumor
resection/main treatment).18−21 Unlike neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy, which
has as its primary advantage the ability to debulk a tumor to enable
surgery, neoadjuvant immunotherapy takes advantage of increased tumor
antigen presence to enable a more potent immune response prior to
surgery that persists after primary tumor resection. As one example,
neoadjuvant immunotherapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab
and nivolumab resulted in greater expansion of tumor-related T cell
clonotypes in peripheral blood than seen with adjuvant immunotherapy
in the OpACIN clinical trial.22

Evolving clinical
paradigms increasingly leave tumor and lymphatics
intact at the time of first immunotherapeutic treatment, creating
opportunities for intratumoral immunotherapy. The following examples
are based primarily around changes in melanoma treatment paradigms
but are emblematic of changes more broadly in cancer treatment as
well. Representative examples of A) the established paradigm for surgery
and immunotherapy sequencing including CLND/SLNB; B) the emerging
paradigm for surgery and immunotherapy sequencing with adjuvant options
dependent on neoadjuvant response; C) opportunities for intratumoral
immunotherapy to interface with the emerging immunotherapeutic paradigm
by modulating tumor-lymphatic crosstalk.

Taken together, over a widening number of cancer types and stages,
there is an increasing number of immunotherapy-eligible patients who
may possess a primary tumor at the time of the first immunotherapeutic
treatment and retain at least some degree of intact lymphatic vasculature
and TDLNs. Tumor-lymphatic crosstalk is thus clinically relevant not
only in terms of disease progression (e.g., metastasis) but also for
therapeutic manipulation of the ongoing antitumor immune response.
Deliberate modulation of this crosstalk has the potential to generate
therapeutic responses both locally and systemically to control both
treated lesions and untreated metastases. In this light, this review
will elaborate on the nature and qualities of immune system crosstalk
facilitated by the tumor-lymphatic tissue interface, detail therapeutically
actionable strategies related to these pathways, and highlight opportunities
for engineered drug delivery systems to favorably manipulate this
crosstalk in the context of intratumoral immunotherapy to improve
treatment efficacy and therapeutic outcomes. Previous cancer immunotherapy
reviews have discussed the biology of immune cell crosstalk in the
tumor, therapeutic pathways for intratumoral immunotherapy, the biology
of immune cell crosstalk in the TDLN, and possibilities for TDLN-targeted
immunotherapy, but these areas have generally been considered as largely
distinct domains rather than viewed as part of a unified tumor/lymphatic
therapeutic strategy.1,6,23,24 Similarly, while previous reviews on drug
delivery have discussed possibilities for engineered drug delivery
systems to mitigate toxicities from intratumoral immunotherapy, to
improve therapeutic retention, and to engineer therapeutic delivery
to the TDLN, they have not explicitly connected these important questions
to an overall goal of simultaneous therapeutic immunomodulation of
the tumor and lymphatic system.25−29 This review synthesizes the emerging clinical immunotherapeutic
paradigm with the rationale for therapeutic modulation of the tumor
and lymphatic system, key pathways with potential for simultaneous
modulation in the tumor and tumor-associated lymphatics/TDLNs, and
modalities and drug delivery technologies relevant to these shared
key pathways as a strategy for improving the treatment efficacy and
therapeutic outcomes of intratumoral immunotherapy.

TDLNs, especially but not
limited to the SLN(s), play a critical
role in the establishment and maintenance of antitumor immunity (Figure 2). Lymph containing
tumor antigen as well as other tumor-derived factors continuously
drain from the tumor microenvironment and surrounding tissue interstitium
via lymphatic capillaries to TDLNs. There, APCs such as dendritic
cells (DCs) that reside in the LN sample lymph-draining antigen for
processing into peptides and presentation on major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) molecules. Alternatively, migratory DCs take up antigens
in the tumor microenvironment before migrating to the TDLN via lymphatic
vessels. DCs presenting tumor antigen can then interact with T cells
to present antigen for T cell priming as well as providing important
secondary signals such as costimulation through the CD28-B7 axis and
proinflammatory cytokines to initiate effective T cell activation
and proliferation.30−32 Critically, this behavior appears restricted to TDLNs,
as recent work has demonstrated that, while T cells can differentiate
in the tumor via interacting with APC niches there, tumor-reactive
T cells undergo priming and clonal expansion in the TDLNs but not
substantially in the tumor or in other lymphoid tissues such as noninvolved
lymph nodes or the spleen.33,34 Because TDLNs are the
primary sites for tumor-reactive T cell activation and expansion,
they form the primary reservoir from which antigen-experienced tumor-reactive
T cells enter the bloodstream and traffic to the tumor microenvironment,
enabling tumor control. Notably, this characteristic of TDLNs is directly
impacted by upstream lymphatic function: research in both mice and
humans has linked higher relative lymphatic gene expression in the
tumor to increased tumor infiltration by lymphocytes.2,35

Tumor-lymphatic
immune crosstalk involves an interplay between
antitumor and pro-tumor immune effects in the lymphatics and TDLNs.
TDLNs facilitate an intersection between tumor antigen, DCs, and T
cells, promoting antitumor effects including tumor-reactive T cell
priming and the formation and maintenance of an immunotherapy-responsive
stem-like T cell niche (bottom right). These effects translate to
antitumor effects within the tumor itself, culminating in effective
cancer cell killing. At the same time, tumors can coopt lymphatics
and TDLNs in order to orchestrate pro-tumor effects, increasing immune
checkpoint expression and suppressive cytokine secretion as well as
promoting DC dysfunction and T cell anergy, resulting ultimately in
tumor escape (top left).

TDLNs are also notable
in that they maintain an immunotherapy-responsive
T cell pool. Seminal work from multiple groups has demonstrated that
stem-like CD8+ T cells, an antigen-experienced CD8+ T cell subset
that retains the capacity for both self-renewal and further differentiation,
are the primary CD8+ T cell subset that responds to therapeutic immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB).36−38 Subsequent work has demonstrated
that a niche of these stem-like CD8+ T cells is maintained in TDLNs
throughout tumor progression, in part due to the role played by migratory
DCs transiting from the tumor microenvironment to the lymph node via
the peritumoral lymphatics.39,40

TDLNs have also
been implicated in mediating the immune response
to and the abscopal effect generated by tumor-directed radiotherapy,
which can in some ways be thought of as a classical example of intratumoral
therapy. For example, tumor-directed radiotherapy has been shown preclinically
to generate an abscopal effect that correlates with enhanced CD8+
T cell proliferation in the TDLN, but only if the TDLN itself is spared
irradiation.41 The generation of potent
immune responses in TDLNs, then, is important for eliciting systemic
immunity and treating distant tumors. Similar findings have corroborated
this in humans, with an immunostimulatory effect observed in the TDLN
in response to low-dose radiation which is abrogated when using high-dose
radiation.42 This implies that an enhanced
antitumor immune response to intratumoral immunotherapy is to some
degree contingent upon intact peritumoral lymphatics and TDLNs.

Despite the critical roles played by the TDLNs and peritumoral
lymphatics in generating and maintaining the antitumor immune response,
the presence of a tumor exerts substantial suppressive effects on
the lymphatics and on TDLNs (Figure 2). One well-documented mechanism for this is the way
in which tumors can bias DCs toward a tolerogenic phenotype, resulting
in dysfunctional or anergic T cell priming in the TDLN. For example,
in both mice and humans, tumor-derived soluble factors such as transforming
growth factor beta (TGF-β) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) reduce
MHC and costimulatory ligand expression and enhance immune checkpoint
ligand expression on DCs in the TDLN.43,44 This has functional
consequences for T cell antitumor activity including increased CD8+
T cell anergy and induction of suppressive CD4+ regulatory T cells
(Tregs).45,46 The immunosuppressive cytokine
IL-10 is also known to be increased in TDLNs with downstream consequences
for TDLN-resident APCs such as reduced costimulatory ligand expression
and downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-12.47 Similarly, tumor-derived M-CSF, GM-CSF, and
IL-6 promote myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment to
and expansion in the TDLN.48

In addition
to suppressive effects exerted by the tumor on APCs,
tumor presence can act on T cells without intermediaries in order
to inhibit T cell function and promote suppressive T cell phenotypes
in the TDLN. In addition to its well-documented effects on APCs, tumor-derived
TGF-β can also directly inhibit T cell differentiation and function.49,50 Furthermore, the TDLN sees preferential differentiation of tumor
antigen-specific CD4+ T cells into Tregs over effector
T cells, even at early stages of tumor growth.51 Perhaps most notoriously, tumor presence is associated
with increased expression of immune checkpoints in the TDLN. Upregulation
of the immune checkpoints programmed cell death protein (PD) 1 and
programmed death ligand (PD-L) 1 on immune cells in the TDLN compared
to other tissues and consequent increases in immune suppression of
T cell function have been extensively demonstrated.7,52 Interaction
between PD-1 on T cells with its ligands, PD-L1 (expressed on a wide
variety of cells including APCs and cancer cells) and PD-L2 (expressed
primarily on APCs) affects T cell signaling downstream of the T cell
receptor (TCR) and costimulatory receptor CD28 to promote T cell inhibition
as well as disrupting TCR-CD8 cooperativity during antigen recognition.53,54 Similarly, cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4),
which limits T cell activation by outcompeting CD28 for costimulatory
ligand binding, is upregulated in the TDLN. Whereas PD-1/PD-L interactions
suppress T cell function in both the TDLN and the TME, CTLA-4 is understood
to be primarily active in the TDLN due to its role in regulating T
cell priming.55 Additional research has
shown increased expression of other immune checkpoints in the TDLN
as well, such as lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), which prevents
CD4+ T cells from interacting efficiently with MHC-II.55,56

Beyond merely exerting effects on immune cells in the TDLN,
tumors
can also modulate the lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) that make
up lymphatic vessels and LN sinuses through diverse mechanisms to
decrease antitumor immune activity. Part of this modulation involves
the induction of passive mechanisms of immune suppression or tolerance.
For example, while LECs constitutively express PD-L1 as part of their
role in maintaining immune homeostasis, PD-L1 is upregulated in tumor-associated
lymphatic vessels in comparison with nonassociated lymphatic vessels
with the result that T cells interacting with these vessels are suppressed.57 LECs can also be coopted to play an active role
in tumor-induced immune suppression: tumor-derived vascular endothelial
growth factor C (VEGF-C) induces LECs in the TDLN to promote the deletion
of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.58 LECs can affect T cell behavior once T cells have migrated to a
tumor site, as well. Multiple groups have demonstrated that, in mice,
T cells can continuously egress the tumor via peritumoral lymphatics
to the TDLN.59,60 Recent investigation into this
phenomenon has shown that the LECs that comprise peritumoral lymphatics
upregulate CXCL12, influencing how different qualities of T cell are
either retained at the tumor site or induced to egress the tumor.61

The importance of the TDLN and peritumoral
lymphatics in mediating
both pro-tumor and antitumor immune activity motivates the use of
therapeutic approaches that modulate these pathways. Because intratumoral
immunotherapy can simultaneously enable greater drug accumulation
in the tumor and increase drug access to the tumor lymphatic basin
compared to systemic administration, it has a unique potential to
simultaneously modulate tumor-lymphatic crosstalk in the tumor, peritumoral
lymphatics, and TDLN.

To date, oncolytic
viruses are the only intratumoral immunotherapy to receive FDA approval,
making them particularly worthy of discussion here. Oncolytic viruses
infect and kill cancer cells, inducing immunogenic cell death and
releasing tumor antigen and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs),
as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the
virus itself, to spur an antitumor immune response.62 Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is an oncolytic herpes
virus that transduces infected cells with a gene encoding the cytokine
GM-CSF in order to enhance DC recruitment to and maturation within
the tumor and is cleared for intratumoral treatment of recurrent unresectable
cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal melanomas in the adjuvant setting.
More recently, T-VEC has also been investigated in the neoadjuvant
setting, demonstrating somewhat improved relapse-free and overall
survival vs resection alone (Table 1).63 The success of T-VEC
has inspired extensive clinical efforts toward oncolytic viruses,
and T-VEC itself may hold important design cues for subsequent effective
oncolytic viruses. Notably, the therapeutic effects seen in response
to T-VEC are likely due to a combination of immunogenic cell death
and other immunomodulatory effects rather than direct viral cancer
cell killing.64 Investigations into patients
receiving T-VEC showed that frequencies of suppressive Tregs and MDSCs were decreased in treated lesions compared to nontreated
lesions and that nontreated lesions had increased infiltration by
CD8+ T cells post-treatment, suggestive of local and potentially also
systemic antitumor immune responses.65,66 However, T-VEC
has not yet been shown to significantly improve overall survival vs
standard of care or have clinically significant effects on distant
metastases to tissues such as the lung or the liver.67 Despite this, as the only FDA-approved intratumoral immunotherapy,
it sets a reasonable threshold for efficacy that other intratumoral
immunotherapies must meet if not exceed.

Clinical investigations
of oncolytic viruses have often neglected
to examine in depth the effects occurring in the SLN (or other TDLNs
if the patient has undergone SLNB) and consequently oncolytic virus
candidates may not be optimized to elicit immunomodulatory effects
in both the tumor and the LN. One possibility to enhance the effects
of oncolytic viruses is to seek to engineer the virus to drive greater
antigen, DAMP, and PAMP release in order to promote a stronger antitumor
immune response both in the tumor and in the TDLN. This can in turn
drive increased DC and T cell recruitment to the treated tumor while
also enhancing antigen and DAMP/PAMP drainage to the TDLN, facilitating
greater T cell priming and increasing the pool of tumor-reactive T
cells with the potential to generate a systemic antitumor T cell response.
Combining an optimized oncolytic virus with other tumor- and TDLN-targeted
approaches such as locoregional ICB might generate substantially improved
therapeutic effects.

Since their development, therapeutic antibodies
have been an important modality for cancer therapy, and their relevance
has increased only since the dawn of ICB therapy as a mainstay of
medical oncology. While their obvious advantages include antigen specificity
and long circulation times due to their ability to engage with neonatal
Fc receptors, an interesting additional feature of therapeutic IgG
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) relevant to this discussion is that their
size (∼150 kDa) is highly amenable to lymphatic uptake and
drainage to the TDLN via peritumoral lymphatics.68,69 Consequently, targeting T cells in the tumor with intratumoral antibodies
can enable simultaneous targeting of T cells in the TDLN. Interestingly,
ICB mAbs currently marketed as systemic therapies are being reformulated
for locoregional delivery, with a subcutaneous version of the aPD-L1
antibody atezolizumab receiving EMA approval in 2023 after showing
noninferior drug exposure and comparable efficacy and safety to intravenous
atezolizumab and similar results for a subcutaneous version of the
aPD-1 antibody nivolumab.70,71 While these formulations
are administered subcutaneously rather than intratumorally and are
not designed to target TDLNs specifically, they represent a conceptual step toward
the clinical realization of intratumoral antibody administration relevant
to this discussion.

The rationale for ensuring delivery of ICB
to the TDLN has been extensively validated in recent years. Preclinical
research has demonstrated that the TDLN is primarily responsible for
the initial immune response to ICB (whether aPD-1, aPD-L1, or aCTLA-4),
and that administering ICB mAbs to T cells in the TDLN alone has similar
immunomodulatory and therapeutic effects to administering ICB to T
cells in the TDLN and in the tumor.52,68 Early in-human
data has confirmed the importance of the SLN in ICB response, with
patients who received a single low dose of the aCTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab
at the tumor resection site before SLNB exhibiting increased effector
T cell activation and reduced Treg presence in both the
SLN and peripheral blood, enhanced antigen-specific peripheral blood
T cell response upon ex vivo restimulation, and even
enhanced migratory DC presence in the SLN.72 Consequently, intratumoral administration of ICB mAbs, which can
increase T cell exposure to mAb in the TDLN as well as in the tumor,
has significant therapeutic potential. In addition, in light of the
upregulation of PD-L1 on LECs in peritumoral lymphatics and in the
TDLN, intratumoral administration of aPD1 or aPD-L1 has the potential
to mitigate the tumor-induced modulation of T cell activity by LECs.
Intratumoral administration is particularly interesting for targeting
immune checkpoints, like CTLA-4, whose inhibition has been well documented
to show dose-dependent antitumor effects but also dose-dependent toxicities.73,74 The ability of intratumoral mAb injection to potentially increase
mAb localization to the TME and lymphatic basin and decrease systemic
tissue exposure can help navigate this complexity.75

Agonistic antibodies against
T cell costimulatory receptors have been a difficult area of exploration
ever since the serious adverse events seen in the clinical trial of
the anti-CD28 superagonist TGN1412.76 Providing
effective costimulation to T cells independently of APCs has potential
to generate significant T cell antitumor responses, but because costimulatory
mAbs are typically given systemically, they tend to come with major
side effects and may be dose-limited at a subeffective dose.77,78 Increasingly, there is increased interest in administering these
modalities intratumorally rather than systemically. One T cell costimulatory
receptor that has attracted significant attention both preclinically
and clinically is the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member
OX40, which has a variety of roles including enabling T cell survival
and regulating cytokine production.79 After
preclinical reports described the potent antitumor effects of intratumoral
OX40 agonism in mice, there are now ongoing early investigations exploring
the intratumoral administration of OX40 agonists in humans.80,81 Other costimulatory receptors such as 4-1BB (CD137) have shown promising
effects in response to intratumoral agonism in preclinical work but
have not yet been investigated for intratumoral administration in
the clinic.82,83

Another interesting therapeutic
pathway that has been successfully utilized in treating hematological
malignancies and that is now increasingly being investigated for solid
tumors is bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), with a recent FDA approval
in uveal melanoma for tebentafusp-tebn. BiTEs are antibodies or fusion
proteins containing both a CD3-binding domain and a tumor antigen-binding
domain, such as CD19 for B cell malignancies or EpCAM for solid tumors,
that can induce T cell activation upon the engagement of both domains.84 Despite BiTEs’ documented clinical success
and increasing investment into developing them for solid tumors, clinical
investigations into intratumorally administered rather than systemically
administered BiTEs remain lacking. Preclinical investigation into
intratumoral administration of oncolytic viruses encoding BiTEs, however,
has demonstrated promising results.85,86 Particularly
relevant for further investigation might be the intratumoral administration
of larger BiTEs (formatted as bispecific antibodies or as fusion proteins
with Fc domains) capable of lymphatic drainage to target metastases
within LNs. In a similar vein, a recent preclinical study reported
that the intratumoral delivery of plasmid encoding agonistic anti-CD3
mAbs in combination with IL-12 drives potent antitumor immunity, lending
further credence to the idea of targeted TCR agonism via intratumoral
administration.87

Agonism of CD40 on DCs,
which leads to upregulation of MHC and
costimulatory ligands, has been shown to be important for effective
antitumor T cell responses.88 The presence
of both resident and migratory DCs in the tumors presents a natural
target for CD40 agonism. Additionally, intratumoral administration
of aCD40 mAbs has been shown preclinically to result in increased
aCD40 accumulation in TDLNs and consequent stimulation of LN-resident
or recently migrated DCs to expand T cells there.89,90 In light of this, there have been some early investigations of intratumoral
CD40 agonism in humans, with a recent clinical trial investigating
the mAb APX005M resulting in increases in T cell activation gene signatures
and clonal diversity in both treated and nontreated lesions, pointing
toward the possibility for this approach to generate both local and
systemic antitumor T cell responses (NCT02706353).91,92

Some therapeutic antibodies
have Fc-dependent immunomodulatory effects in addition to immunomodulatory
effects resulting from targeted agonism or antagonism. In mice, treatment
with certain clones of aCTLA-4 mAbs can deplete intratumoral Tregs, enhancing the antitumor immune response. However, examination
of clinical data has revealed that neither of the two FDA-approved
aCTLA-4 mAbs (ipilimumab and tremelimumab) result in significant intratumoral
Treg depletion in humans in their current clinical context
of systemic administration, but only when administered intratumorally,
further motivating the use of intratumoral aCTLA-4.75,93 At the same time, because preclinical studies have indicated that
aCTLA-4 mAbs are most effective when both their Fc-independent and
Fc-dependent functions are engaged, engineering aCTLA-4 mAbs capable
of better depleting intratumoral Tregs in humans has attracted
substantial interest. For example, gotistobart, an aCTLA-4 mAb that
is designed to enhance Treg depletion in the tumor, is
currently in phase 3 trials but is designed for systemic administration
(NCT05671510). Conceivably, even next-generation aCTLA-4 antibodies
like this one could benefit from intratumoral administration in order
to increase the mAb concentration and Treg depletion in
the tumor and TDLN while seeking to minimize Treg depletion
in off-target tissues. Another example of a therapeutic antibody capable
of depleting Tregs is a OX40. Preclinical data indicate
that intratumoral aOX40 administration, in addition to its stimulatory
effects on T cells via OX40 agonism, causes activating Fc receptor-dependent
Treg depletion in the tumor, further underscoring the opportunities
available to engineer therapeutic antibodies to simultaneously stimulate
effector T cells while also depleting Tregs following intratumoral
administration.80

Pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists including toll-like
receptor (TLR) agonists and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
agonists have potent immunostimulatory effects on APCs, increasing
MHC and costimulatory ligand expression and inducing proinflammatory
cytokine production. Intratumoral administration of PRR agonists may
be critical for their success: not only do these agents see limited
tumor and LN access from systemic administration, but because many
of these modalities are nucleic acids, they are subject to rapid degradation in vivo. Indeed, early clinical trials of systemically administered
TLR agonists were unsuccessful in spurring significant therapeutic
responses at acceptable levels of toxicity. Intratumorally administered
PRR agonists, on the other hand, have generated promising preclinical
data indicating their ability to modulate immune responses in both
the tumor and TDLN. Recent examples of this have included TLR3 agonists,
dual TLR7/8 and RIG-I agonists, and STING agonists.94−98 This in turn has prompted a degree of interest in
intratumoral administration of PRR agonists in humans, including agonists
against TLR3, TLR7/8, or TLR9, and STING agonists, with some early
reports indicating promising results such as increased T cell infiltration
and TME remodeling in treated tumors and signs of systemic T cell
response (NCT04695977, NCT06343077, NCT06022029, NCT04799054).99 However, it remains to be seen whether intratumoral
administration of these drugs without coupling them with an engineered
delivery system will consistently induce therapeutic responses. Despite
preclinical evidence suggesting immunostimulatory effects in the TDLN
downstream of effects in the tumor, PRR agonists themselves may be
limited in their ability to consistently access peritumoral lymphatics
and the TDLNs, for reasons discussed in later sections, at least without
undesirable systemic effects being simultaneously elicited. Given
the significant immunosuppressive effects within the tumor microenvironment,
delivery of PRR agonists to APCs within the tumor alone may be insufficient
to consistently induce potent antitumor immunity in humans and novel
drug delivery approaches may be necessary in order to achieve therapeutically
relevant delivery to both the tumor and the TDLN.

Cytokines
have been of great interest for cancer immunotherapy due to their
potent immunomodulatory effects. Indeed, some of the earliest FDA-approved
cancer immunotherapies were cytokines, with the approvals of interferon
(IFN) alpha for high-risk melanoma and high-dose interleukin (IL)
2 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma. However,
while systemically administered cytokines can spur durable responses,
only a small fraction of patients respond and at the cost of significant
toxicities such as capillary leak syndrome.25 Intratumoral cytokine administration can potentially increase drug
accumulation in the TME and tumor-associated lymphatics to improve
therapeutic effects while also reducing systemic exposure, and consequently
has been an increasingly attractive option.100 This approach has recently seen some success in humans with the
combination neoadjuvant therapy daromun, which consists of the cytokines
IL-2 and TNF fused to tumor-targeting antibody L19 to enhance tumor
retention. Intratumoral daromun treatment induced abscopal effects
in nontreated tumors in a phase 2 trial and improved recurrence-free
survival in a phase 3 trial (NCT02938299).69,101 A variation on this approach that has also garnered significant
attention is intratumorally administering mRNA that encodes cytokines
rather than administering the cytokines themselves. Recent preclinical
work, for example, has explored the possibility of using intratumorally
administered mRNA encoding a fusion protein combining IL-12 with a
CD137 agonist and a TGF-β antagonist and observed both therapeutic
effects in the treated tumor as well as abscopal effects.102 Similar approaches are currently undergoing
investigation in humans, including a trial with mRNA encoding IL-23
and IL-36γ along with OX40 ligand and a trial with mRNA encoding
IL-12 (NCT03739931, NCT05539157). Promisingly, previous in-human data
have indicated that intratumoral cytokine treatment results in changes
in the lymphocyte compartment in the TDLNs as well as in the tumor,
highlighting the opportunities for intratumoral cytokines to modulate
immune crosstalk in the TDLN as well as the injected tumor.103

Notwithstanding the opportunities presented by various
classes of intratumoral immunotherapy in isolation, the greatest therapeutic
potential may lie in exploring combinations of these modalities in
order to provoke synergistic effects while simultaneously mitigating
the toxicities that might be seen with the same combinations administered
systemically. Possible approaches could include, for example, simultaneously
enhancing immunogenic cell death (e.g., via an oncolytic virus) and
providing T cell costimulation (aOX40) or stimulating APCs (PRR agonist)
and blocking T cell inhibition while depleting Tregs (aCTLA-4).
While there has yet to be extensive clinical investigation along these
lines, recent preclinical data have helped underscore this possibility.
One group demonstrated preclinically that combination intratumoral
administration of a TLR9 agonist and OX40 agonist substantially enhanced
the T cell response and antitumor activity in primary and metastatic
tumors as well as in TDLNs.104 Others have
shown marked tumor reduction in response to the combination of aCTLA-4,
aCD137, and aOX40 as a result of substantial antibody accumulation
in both the tumor and the TDLN, while still others have demonstrated
significant immunomodulatory effects in both the tumor and TDLN arising
following coadministration intratumorally of a TLR3 agonist and a
STING agonist.105,106 Similarly, recent preclinical
work has shown that intratumoral TLR9 agonist and IL-12 with or without
aOX40 results in profound effects in the tumor and TDLN as well as
abscopal effects.107 Because of the difficulties
inherent in achieving effective drug accumulation in the tumor and
TDLN even in the context of intratumoral administration, however,
these therapeutic strategies can benefit from using engineered drug
delivery systems (DDSs) that are optimized for intratumoral immunotherapy.

An important factor to consider in the design
of intratumoral immunotherapies
to modulate tumor-lymphatic crosstalk is the extent to which a drug
will reach the target tissues and target cell populations necessary
for maximum efficacy. This consideration can be seen with the radioactive
tracers typically used for lymphatic mapping, which are typically
between 10 and 200 nm in diameter to prevent rapid clearance from
the site of injection and enable lymphatic drainage and LN accumulation.108 On one hand, for modalities like oncolytic
viruses it may suffice to achieve drug delivery primarily in the injected
tumor and not in the TDLN, provided that the virus is sufficiently
engineered to drive the release of antigen and DAMPs/PAMPs that can
then drain via lymphatics. On the other hand, modalities like PRR
agonists and some cytokines have significant direct effects both in
the tumor and in the TDLN but are also relatively small in size (<5
nm hydrodynamic diameter). Cargoes in this size range do not see appreciable
lymphatic exposure and are rapidly cleared from the tumor following
intratumoral administration—meaning the administration of the
drug by itself may be insufficient to achieve optimal immunomodulation
in both the tumor and the lymphatic system (Figure 3).109,110 This dilemma highlights
the opportunity to use engineered DDSs that can be tuned to achieve
drug exposure in the TDLN as well as in the tumor to maximize therapeutic
effects while also reducing systemic exposure and related toxicities.

Engineered
drug delivery systems improve the ability of intratumoral
immunotherapy to modulate tumor-lymphatic immune crosstalk by improving
drug access to and effects in both the tumor and the TDLN. Intratumorally
administered therapies by themselves can transiently modulate immunity
in the tumor but struggle to effectively access the lymphatics/TDLN,
with antibodies seeing some accumulation but other modalities such
as PRR agonists and cytokines seeing minimal LN access (left). Engineered
drug delivery systems such as depot-forming/hydrogel systems and nanocarrier-based
systems (right) can simultaneously enhance intratumoral immunotherapy
access to tumor lymphatics/TDLNs to amplify antitumor immunity in
those tissues as well as improve the effects in the tumor (e.g., by
reducing rates of drug clearance).

Sustained-release or depot-forming systems represent
one potential answer to the question of how to reduce systemic drug
clearance after intratumoral administration and can be further manipulated
to enhance the drug uptake by lymphatics. Many of these approaches
involve developing hydrogels from biocompatible materials such as
alginate or Pluronic that have desirable properties such as undergoing
sol–gel transitions at physiological temperatures after drug
loading and can be safely administered intratumorally. When applied
to therapeutic antibodies such as ICB mAbs, these systems not only
can enable increased antibody retention at the tumor site but also
can sustain antibody access to the TDLN, whether passively by shifting
the balance of antibody blood clearance vs lymphatic clearance in
favor of the lymphatics or actively by shedding lymph-draining antibody-containing
micelles.111,112 These systems can also be engineered
to enhance the simultaneous tumor and lymphatic delivery of smaller
drugs such as PRR agonists. For example, TLR agonist-containing polyamide-based
nanocarriers capable of draining through lymphatic capillaries to
be taken up by DCs in the TDLN were released from a polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-based hydrogel that was modified to respond to reactive oxygen
species.113 Additionally, hydrogels comprised
of PEG-based microspheres to which a TLR agonist can be connected
by a degradable linker have been developed, resulting in APC activation
and T cell stimulation in both TDLNs and tumors.114 Notably, hydrogels can also be manipulated to deliver multiple
classes of drug simultaneously, such as PRR agonist and antibody or
PRR agonist and cytokine.115,116 Another noteworthy
approach involves tethering the therapeutic modality of interest to
a depot-forming system to improve drug retention at the tumor site.
For example, IL-12 tethered to the depot-forming vaccine adjuvant
aluminum hydroxide enhanced immune activity in the tumor and resulted
in enhanced T cell activity in TDLNs and is currently being evaluated
in humans (NCT06171750).117

Nanocarriers that are
optimally sized to enter peritumoral lymphatics and drain to TDLNs
are another potential solution for efficiently modulating tumor-lymphatic
immune crosstalk. A variety of approaches toward this goal have been
explored, with some additionally achieving a degree of sustained release
by balancing injection site retention and lymphatic drainage or successfully
limiting systemic exposure by constraining nanocarrier/drug accumulation
to the tumor and the TDLN. Various groups have used nanoparticles
to intratumorally administer cargoes as diverse as antibodies, STING
agonists, and TLR agonists. In doing so, they have demonstrated biodistribution
that is primarily limited to the tumor, peritumoral lymphatics, and
TDLN as well as immunomodulatory effects including DC maturation,
T cell activation, and cytokine secretion in those tissues.118−122 Many of these efforts feature interesting design features to enhance
targeted drug delivery. One such effort involved the synthesis of
photosensitive and matrix metalloprotease-2-degradable PEG-based nanoparticles
loaded with aPD-L1 that improved drug accumulation following irradiation
not only in the primary TDLN but in TDLNs further downstream as well.118 Another involved the development of PEG/polyphosphoester-based
nanoparticles loaded with TLR agonist that, when injected intratumorally
after magnetic hyperthermia treatment, were capable of noncovalently
adsorbing tumor antigen on the surface of the particle before draining
to the TDLN thus in principle enabling simultaneous TLR agonist and
antigen delivery to TDLN DCs.120 In another
interesting approach, PEG- and poly lactic-co-glycolic
acid (PLGA)-derived nanoparticles that were functionalized with tannic
acid were formed, enabling the lymph-draining nanoparticles to enter
LN conduits and penetrate deep into the LN to target T cells and DCs
in the paracortex rather than arresting in the subcapsular sinus.121 A subset of nanocarrier work has investigated
deploying biopolymers such as glatiramer acetate or glycol chitosan
with intrinsic adjuvant properties for intratumoral immunotherapy.
Formulations of these biopolymers can form particle solutions upon
injection capable of both stimulating APCs in the TME and draining
via lymphatics to stimulate APCs in TDLNs.123,124 Given the enormous wave of interest in liposomes and lipid nanoparticles
(LNPs) leading up to but especially in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic and the successful LNP-mRNA vaccines, there have also been
recent forays into using LNPs for intratumoral administration of therapeutic
cargoes including antibodies, cytokines, and STING agonists as well
as mRNA encoding a variety of cargoes such as cytokines, costimulatory
ligands, and novel fusion proteins.102,125−128 Intratumorally administered mRNA LNPs are particularly interesting
for their potential to turn immune cells in both the tumor and the
TDLN into factories producing specific immunostimulatory antibodies
or cytokines, in contrast to intratumorally administered naked mRNA
which results in protein translation in the tumor but not the TDLN.127,128 Particularly interesting will be in-human data indicating the extent
to which intratumorally administered LNPs are able to mitigate the
liver tropism for which LNPs are generally known.129 Another interesting development has been the functionalization
of nanocarriers, such as polymeric nanoparticles or LNPs with agonistic
aCD3 antibodies or binding domains from aCD3 antibodies. Administration
of such particles can not only stimulate T cells but can also deliver
cargoes like mRNA or small molecule drugs to those same T cells and
could enable highly specific T cell targeting in the tumor and TDLNs.130,131

Many exciting opportunities are emerging for
intratumoral immunotherapy
to modulate tumor-lymphatic immune crosstalk. Approaches using DDSs
to deliver combinations of immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., cytokine
and PRR agonist, cytokine and mAb, PRR agonist and mAb) to both the
tumor and the lymphatic system have the potential to overcome some
of the limitations of monotherapies, though a clearer understanding
of potential toxicities from intratumoral combination therapy may
be necessary before clinical success is achieved. Given the increasing
interest in developing BiTEs for solid tumors, there may also be value
in pursuing the intratumoral administration of BiTEs either in protein
form or encoded by oncolytic virus to target both the tumor and TDLN,
along with other forms of therapeutic intratumoral TCR agonism.

Beyond the approaches detailed here, there are also newfound insights
and developing therapeutic approaches that may be applied to an intratumoral
immunotherapeutic paradigm. For example, therapies that remodel the
TME and lymphatic system in order to enable increased T cell recruitment,
infiltration, and retention in the TME require further investigation.
Recent work has identified the formation of immunotherapy-inducible
tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within the TME that enable increased
T cell infiltration into and survival in the tumor.132−134 Various chemokines and cytokines, including CCL21, CXCL13, LIGHT,
and lymphotoxin (LT) β, have all been implicated in TLS formation.132,135 There may be an opportunity to use DDSs to engineer enhanced TLS
formation in the TME to synergize with other immunotherapies. For
example, sustained-release or depot-forming systems could be loaded
with recombinant LIGHT or agonistic LTβR mAbs to increase the
level of T cell infiltration into the TME, potentially improving the
effects of ICB. Immunomodulatory small molecules also represent a
plausible use case for DDSs. Particularly interesting are inhibitors
of the enzyme protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that can enhance
TCR and cytokine signaling in T cells and demonstrate significant
antitumor potential. Inhibition of PTPN1 and PTPN2 has been shown
to enhance CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine secretion
in response to antigen stimulus ex vivo and to increase
TIL density in vivo.136−139 Because systemic administration
of these potent inhibitors in humans raises questions around safety
and tolerability, modalities like these could also benefit from targeted
delivery to tumors and TDLNs.

The intentional
therapeutic modulation of not only the tumor but
also the tumor-associated lymphatic system offers opportunities for
augmenting antitumor immune activity to achieve curative therapeutic
efficacy in advanced disease. To aid in this goal, the development
of engineered DDSs to better enable the manipulation of tumor-lymphatic
crosstalk is critical. In an emerging practice era characterized by
less invasive LN biopsy and removal, as well as more immunotherapies
being initiated in the neoadjuvant stage, previously overlooked opportunities
in the design of intratumoral immunotherapies offer unique advantages
to define new paradigms of cancer immunotherapy. While recent late-phase
clinical trials of intratumoral immunotherapies in advanced or metastatic
cancers have succeeded in generating promising local responses, most
have yet to consistently achieve durable systemic benefit—likely
due in part to failures to generate sufficiently potent systemic antitumor
immune responses.140 Due to intratumorally
administered immunotherapies offering both therapeutic effects within
the injected tumor as well as access to LNs where systemically active
antitumor immune responses can be modulated, opportunities exist to
incorporate recent insights into tumor-lymphatic crosstalk and advances
in DDSs in order to design intratumoral immunotherapies that, in addition
to providing local control, also enhance and amplify systemic immunity.
