Title: New insights from nanotechnology in SARS-CoV-2 detection, treatment strategy, and prevention

The current global health threat is the novel coronavirus infection-2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in 630 million infections and 65 million deaths (as of November 21, 2022). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family and contains (single stranded RNA) in the beta form. The SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a number of different types of symptoms, such as an asymptomatic condition or symptoms leading to death.

For SARS-CoV-2, no effective antiviral treatment has been found. The treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out on the basis of symptoms and depending on the severity of the illness. However, certain antiviral drugs were reportedly used in the treatment of COVID-19 such as ribavirin, ritonavir, and remdesivir to bring down the viral load and avert further complications [1]. Remdesivir was found successful and efficient in the treatment of the very first patient in the United States with a promising outcome [2]. However, clinical trials for antiviral drugs to be performed in a randomized controlled form are lagging because of the lengthy procedures required to ensure their safety and efficacy. Although, in accumulated evidence of a report inclusive of 42 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 21% were given corticosteroids. Corticosteroids was used for the suppression of lung inflammation [3] but later on the utilization of corticosteroids was not accepted, as observed from the clinical outcomes. In an experimental study of critically ill adults of 309, all the patients treated with corticosteroids were vulnerable to take support of mechanical ventilators [4]. Vaccine development is a crucial and ultimate treatment of any disease, it not only controls the transmission rate of an ongoing pandemic but also prevents its further spread in the future. However, the administration of a vaccine cannot be completely free from risks or complications. One such drawback is vaccine-associated autoimmunity. In vaccine-associated autoimmunity, the adjuvants or the antigens’ cross-reactions may sometimes be causative factors [5]. It is further complicated in patients already battling immune-mediated diseases and could lead to a cascade of immunological responses in the body. Ultimately, the introduction of novel viral strains and/or mutations in the viral genome leaves the conventional treatments ineffective.

The COVID-19 epidemic is projected to extend long beyond 2022, putting even more strain on the world's already overcrowded healthcare system. Exploring methods and treatments based on nanotechnology to tackle COVID-19 will aid in overcoming the limits of traditional viral illness management strategies. As a result, scientists are focusing their efforts on new nanotechnology-based innovations that have the potential to dramatically lessen the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploring and implementing prevention, diagnosis, and therapy based on nanotechnology, a paradigm shift in the battle of COVID-19 vs. mankind war will be very prominent [6]. For example, Moderna collaborated with the Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institutes of Health to develop and carry out clinical trials for mRNA-encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) vaccine [7]. Another mRNA-based vaccine was developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, which is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in an emergency situation to prevent COVID-19 [8]. Both BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna have been using LNPs for the mRNA vaccine that encode the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The S protein is the viral protein that interacts with ACE2 on cells to mediate infection. Thus, the S protein is a potential vaccine target because it is considered that antibodies attach to the right epitope on the S protein and may be neutralizing, preventing intercellular viral transmission. These are a few instances of how nanotechnology-based methods have been used to treat SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we reviewed several strategies using nanotechnology to treat SARS-CoV-2 (Section 3.2). The present review examines nanomedicine approaches and their potent implementation that could aid in a better management of the COVID-19 pandemic, attributed to the nanoscale structures and their advantages.

In this article, we have analyzed nanotechnology-based antiviral strategies and explored how they are being developed to tackle SARS-CoV-2 from three perspectives. First, we have reviewed the designs of NPs that can be used to quickly, accurately, and conveniently detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Second, we have examined NP designs that use host mimicry to either enhance the activity of already-existing antiviral agents or develop wholly new antiviral mechanisms. In the third section, we have gone through SARS-CoV-2 prevention strategies using NPs. Researchers would be benefitted from the nanotechnology-based methodologies discussed in this study and aid in generating novel COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment modalities.

The origin of the disease remains a puzzle and debatable. There are no clear explanations as to how it emerged in the human population. Human coronaviruses first appeared in the literature, in the mid-1960s, isolated by Tyrrell and Bynoe, who were experimenting with human strains and many animal viruses [9]. The coronavirus was first discovered in the cultures isolated from the human embryonic trachea taken from the respiratory tract of an adult having a common cold. The virus's name is derived from its crown-like (“corona” in Latin) morphological appearance of coronaviruses established by Almeida and Tyrrell [10,11].

In December 2019, in Wuhan, China, multiple pneumonia cases emerged. The WHO first assigned the name of the causative virus as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, later its nomenclature was changed to SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Through the research conducted, the SARS CoV-2 basic reproduction number (R0) came to be around 2.2 according to the evaluation report [12]. After several pneumonia cases emerged in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 was promptly isolated from the patient in a very short period by the scientists in China and initiated its genome sequencing. According to the research, the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence has a 79.5% match with SARS-CoV-1. Furthermore, it showed a 96% genome similarity with RaTG13, a bat coronavirus [13]. Thus, on the basis of evolutionary studies and genome similarity, the bat has been considered the foremost suspect as a prime biological host of SARS-CoV-2.

Thorough research of the viral protein structure and its impact on its functionality while interacting with the host machinery is necessary to understand to combat the virus. It exists usually in a spherical shape and in a nanoscale diameter; however, a larger pleomorphic particulate shape is also prevalent. Studies were conducted to examine the SARS-CoV-2 structure utilizing the transmission electron microscope (Fig. 1
A) [14].Fig. 1SARS-CoV-2 structure examined under the transmission electron microscope (A) (Figure adopted from Ref. [14]). A schematic diagram of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (B). Genomic organization of SARS-CoV-2 (C) (Figure adopted from Ref. [13]).Fig. 1

The examination of SARS-CoV-2 deciphered the structure alike the other coronaviruses, wherein the virus size ranged from 70 to 90 nm [13]. Coronaviruses are single stranded RNAviruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family [15,16]. The SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins consist of a nucleocapsid protein (N), a small envelope protein (E), a matrix protein (M), and a spike surface glycoprotein (S) (Fig. 1B). The helical nucleocapsid is surrounded by the envelope. Further, it is encircled by the membrane and the spike protein (S). These three proteins mainly get incorporated into the host membrane lipid bilayer [17].

The coronavirus genome consists of 9,680 amino acid polyproteins, coding 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs) approximately 26–32 kb (Fig. 1C) [12]. The first ORF, which encodes 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), makes up roughly 67% of the genome, while the other ORFs code for the other structural proteins [13]. Most of the encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 match to that of the known SARS-CoV-2. Several studies have attempted to conclude that the mutation in NSP2 and NSP3 is responsible for its infectious capability and helps in various differentiation mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 [12].

We know that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the highly expressed functional receptor in the human lungs. This makes it the primary site of infection. Hence, the common symptoms of COVID-19 are related to respiration and can be mild to the severe respiratory uneasiness that the patient may require hospitalization (Fig. 2
).Fig. 2A schematic representation of the mode of spread of COVID-19.Fig. 2

A schematic representation of the mode of spread of COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted from one human to another. It is majorly spread by coughing and sneezing. Moreover, the virus particles were identified in aerosols at infectious concentrations for up to 3 h or even long-lasting. Further, there is evidence that suggests that it is transmitted via aerosols [18].

Direct contact with infected patients is another mode of transmission. Fomite transmission is also been reported for these viral particles due to their capability of remaining for a period of time on the surfaces, depending on the surface material [19]. Other means of transmission include sexual intercourse, according to recent data, oral-fecal transmission might also be possible (Fig. 3
) [20]. Given the thoroughly studied evidence, vertical transmission of COVID-19 is also possible. The standard and conventional methods for detecting COVID-19 infection are the identification of the viral RNA through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The presence of COVID-19 viral RNA-positive serology was also noted in several fetal or neonatal sources [21].Fig. 3A schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 mode of entry and its replication (Figure adopted from Ref. [22]).Fig. 3

A schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 mode of entry and its replication (Figure adopted from Ref. [22]).

COVID-19 gradually became a pandemic as it has a broad spectrum of manifestations. Majorly, the SAR-CoV-2-positive cases reported had mild indications of the disease or showed no symptoms at all. The classic symptoms of COVID-19 include breathlessness, cold, and cough, with subsequent fundamental other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and body ache [3]. Out of these, the most prevailing symptom in 98% of the symptomatic cases is fever. Additional symptoms are pharyngitis, i.e. pain or scratchiness in the throat, loss of smell and taste, head and muscle aches, chills, and tremors. The virus takes 14 days to incubate in the human body followed by infection, and symptoms often appear 3–7 days afterward.

To avert COVID-19 from fast spreading, it was crucial to implement rapid diagnostic methods. The RNA-based PCR and SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests were approved by the FDA to diagnose the COVID-19 infection. Further, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, 162 antigen-based rapid test kits have been validated to date [23].

Antigen tests are less expensive and able to give results immediately compared to PCR tests. But PCR tests give more accurate results than antigen tests. Therefore, doctors may recommend a PCR test for further confirmation. At present, the most widely utilized diagnostic test is PCR. Samples can be extracted from swabs taken from the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal regions. Also, sputum, stool, saliva, and fluid derived from the lower respiratory tract and blood are implied as the sample as well.

The most conventional diagnostic method for detecting lung infections is a chest X-ray, which is estimated to be around 69% sensitive in the case of patients with positive results [24]. Also, the chest X-ray can be negative in 25% of cases too [25].

Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-positive nucleic acid presence can be diagnosed by utilizing fluorescence probe-based real-time RT-PCR. However, this diagnostic method gets influenced by various environmental factors such as specimen sampling, handling while processing the procedure, and the detection reagents used. As a result, most of the cases show errors in reports or false positive results. Also, the period to conclude the result is too lengthy. Three issues are majorly faced with the RT-PCR method for diagnosis [26,27]: first, due to the increased demand for PCR reagent kits during excessive testing, the supplies don't match adequate standards. Second, high-sampling specimens are not manageable by the rural community hospitals and they lack the needed infrastructure for carrying out the procedure and running PCR. Third, the RT-PCR result depends on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the particular sample and the sampling time point taken, i.e. when a person who was asymptomatic in the beginning and is now on the verge of recovery takes a PCR test, his/her prior infection would not be identified and thereby adequate control measures would not be taken on time [28].

A computer tomography scan is an alternative method that uses the principle of imaging for diagnosing and conducting clinical check-ups of COVID-19 patients. Computer tomography scans are not affordable for the majority of patients, their handling is complex and therefore demands good experience and high technical expertise, and it fails to safely diagnose COVID-19. Hence, other techniques need to be taken into consideration to address these shortcomings for the COVID-19 diagnosis.

COVID-19 treatment depends on its severity. For a less severe condition, the patient can be treated at home by resting and taking medicine to reduce fever. Antiviral tablets such as Favipiravir, earlier known as T-705, might be taken orally. It halts the replication of viral RNA by inhibiting the RNA polymerase. The dose of the antiviral depends on the type of the infection severity. The more severe cases require hospitalization with treatment that includes intravenous antivirals such as remdesivir (received the approval from FDA for hospitalized patients' treatment in October 2020) and corticosteroids. Moreover, supplemental oxygen-assisted ventilation and other invasive or non-invasive treatments were supplemented in the hospitals to the COVID-19 patients to support their recovery and aid to fight the infection. The use of blood plasma of a person previously infected with COVID-19 is another potential therapy that comes under conventional treatment which supplements patients’ immune systems. Multiple efforts are currently ongoing to control and treat COVID-19.

According to infection severity, the monoclonal antibodies for enhanced targeted drug treatment, as effective as an antiviral against most of the COVID-19 causing viral strains, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and various supplementary vitamins are recommended to treat COVID-19. Cannabidiol, Zinc supplements, Vitamin-D, Ivermectin (Ivermectin), Vitamin-C, and Doxycycline combinations have been used for boosting the immunity of the patients and lessening the severity. Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved worldwide. A vaccine elicits the body's adaptive immune system by mimicking a particular pathogen, exposing its specific antigens, and later when the actual infection happens, the body's immune system reacts strongly against it [29].

Various companies produced a wide array of vaccines against the viral strains causing COVID-19. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna companies came up mRNA-based vaccines with 94–95% effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2. A recombinant ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Corona virus vaccine is manufactured by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, a joint venture. It is a chimpanzee adenovirus vector that is replication-deficient and encodes for the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Another recombinant COVID vaccine named COVISHIELD™ was developed by the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd [30]. The efficiency of the vaccine was studied thoroughly in several countries like the UK, Brazil, and South Africa [31]. Recently, the WHO authorized the use of ChAdOx1-S, which was jointly developed by the Serum Institute, India, and AstraZeneca-SKBio (the Republic of Korea). It is also a vector-based vaccine and has 63.09% efficacy [29]. In India, Bharat Biotech collaborated with the Indian Council of Medical Research, National Institute of Virology, and developed India's first indigenous vaccine, COVAXIN®, to combat COVID-19 [32]. It has been developed as an inactivated vaccine using ‘Whole Virion Inactivated Vero Cell Technology’ with the vaccine adjuvant to boost immunogenicity. Another vaccine named as Sinopharm Beijing (BBIBP-CorV), developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd has shown the efficacy of 79% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of 14 days or more after the second dose and hospitalized patients [33]. On April 16, 2020, Beijing Kexing Zhongwei Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (sinovac), a division of Kexing Biology, began the phase I/II clinical study of the Coronavirus inactivated vaccine, which was made available on June 13, 2020 [34]. The findings indicated that more than 90% of neutralizing antibodies tested positively. Additionally, the precise findings of the phase III clinical trials carried out by Brazilian medical professionals revealed that two doses of the Sinovac Coronavirus vaccine provided 100% protection for moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 and 50.7% protection for symptomatic individuals. The adenovirus vector vaccine: type 5 adenovirus vector vaccine (Ad5-nCoV vaccine) produced by Tianjin Kangxinuo Company is a single-dose adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that was well-tolerated and immunogenic in phase 1 and 2 studies [35]. In the phase 3 clinical trial, the observed results suggested that the Ad5-nCoV vaccine was highly effective against serious infection and protected against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The FDA provisionally approved the recombinant new coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells) developed by Anhui zhifeilong Kema biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. on March 1st [36]. According to the State Food and Drug Administration's official website, it is the first domestic recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine that has been authorized and is useful for preventing diseases caused by the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Following vaccines are considered to be effective against emerging new COVID-19 variants, however, there are certain adverse side effects experienced following vaccine immunization such as pain due to inflammation at the injected site, muscle pain, and fever [37]. The vaccines manufactured do not have 100% efficiency and hence chances of re-infection exist even after vaccination. Moreover, an efficient strategy is required for determining the accurate rate of vaccine production to meet the high demand to fulfill vaccination covering the maximum population within a short period [38]. There are several limitations to the process of vaccination. Although mRNA vaccines are considered to be one of the safest vaccines, as it shows no risk of genomic integration, mRNA/DNA vaccines work as continuous antigen-generating machinery. Thus, it may not trigger the desired immune response in the host's body at the optimum level needed. It may even cause immunogenic effects and as a result, lead to T-cell exhaustion [39]. Other than this drawback, additionally nucleic acid-based vaccines trigger type I interferon production in response to the vaccine-associated inflammation that may lead to the development of an autoimmune disease [40]. A better understanding of these prophylactic agents and overcoming their drawbacks using alternative approaches and technologies are required to combat the COVID-19 pandemic more safely and efficiently.

One way to conquer these shortcomings and build an effective treatment against the viral infection is to adopt a multidisciplinary approach. This motivates scientists to explore the field of nanotechnology, which has recently gained popularity and is being positively scrutinized for its potential utilization in combating viral infections by including its usage in developing preventive treatment [41,42]. NPs provide distinctive physical properties that have been majorly elucidated for their advantages in drug delivery technology. The efficient coordination between nanostructures and microorganisms is transforming the biomedical field at a fast pace and is considered to be the potent ideal solution so far. The recent advances in nanomedicine have led to the advantages such as targeted drug delivery, biocompatibility, and its potential to procure slow, sustained, and targeted drug release, which offers the upper hand to overcome challenges linked with the conventional drug-related treatments and therapies [43].

Nanotechnology is the field dealing with the study and application of materials having a diameter of fewer than 100 nm [[44], [45], [46]]. Nanotechnology applications can be found in a variety of domains, including biomedicine, material engineering, chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer engineering [47]. Recently, nanotechnology has bloomed in the field of biological sciences as it has potently aided advancement in the aspects of advancing new diagnostics and therapeutics. The application of nanotechnology is widely desired in the field of medical sciences due to its special qualities, such as providing more surface area to a volume ratio due to its nanoscale size, aiding multifunctionality, improved solubility, and surface adaptability. These qualities aid in developing targeted therapies, efficient novel drug candidates, early diagnostic tools, and patient personalized medicines, which will be safer and more effective than the existing options. The potential of nanotechnology is undeniable in the present COVID-19 pandemic scenario. The following are some of the benefits of nanomaterials in antiviral studies.•Aids in the administration of water-insoluble pharmaceuticals [48,49].•Increases the circulation of medicines to circulate in the body [[50], [51], [52]].•It is possible to improve drug efficiency and reduce side effects [[53], [54], [55]].•By protecting DNA and mRNA vaccines, it overcomes obstacles for in vivo applications [56,57].•Capacity to carry multiple drugs/vaccines simultaneously [[58], [59], [60]].

Despite our growing understanding of antiviral strategies and the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, the present medications for COVID-19 therapeutics are inefficient and have side effects. Nanotechnology-based strategies can be utilized in a variety of ways to combat COVID-19, including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment (Fig. 4
).Fig. 4A schematic representation of the nano-medicinal approaches for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.Fig. 4

A schematic representation of the nano-medicinal approaches for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

In this section, we have explored that the nanotechnology-based approaches for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 aim to take less time for detection and aiding a simple approach. Additionally, an approach for the development of targeted nano-drug delivery systems for anti-viral therapeutics was discussed. Furthermore, we have explored nano-formulations that aim to ameliorate the efficiency of the present antiviral drugs. In the end of the section, novel nanomaterials used in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 was discussed.

Infectious COVID-19 outbreaks around the world demand the development of quick and effective diagnostic technologies. Nucleic acid detection-based tests through RT-PCR have several drawbacks, including high instances of false results, lack of sensitivity, time taking process to reach the results, and limited specificity due to genetic homology with other viruses [61]. Furthermore, rural healthcare facilities lack the essential PCR infrastructure to handle huge sample volumes, and the availability of sufficient RT-PCR reagents and kits is not enough to suffice the growing demand during the COID-19 pandemic [62]. A precise diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial to improve the patients’ prognosis. Thus, the generation of sensitive nucleic acid or protein-based point-of-care diagnostic tools to test SARS-CoV-2 more specifically is urgently in demand. Various nanomaterials are used for SARS-CoV-2 identification including metal NPs , polymeric NPs , dendrimers, etc. These NPs are frequently described as being suited for a wide range of biosensing activities and biomedical applications, where the NPs would interact with RNA, DNA, or antibodies mainly for identifying viruses [63,64]. Additionally, in point-of-care devices too, NPs have been utilized due to their advantages such as their nano-feature size, aid in precise sensing, infer chemical stability, excellent electrical conductivity, and the localized surface plasmon resonanceeffect) [[65], [66], [67]]. The introduction of NPs in analytical equipment could improve detection systems' sensitivity and specificity. Several nanomaterials detection platforms have been generated for quick and precise SARS-CoV detection. Colorimetric assays based on NPs [68,69], optical sensors [70,71], nano immunosensors [72,73], immunochromatographic assays [74], aptamer-based assays [75], and bio-barcode assays (BCAs) [[76], [77], [78], [79]] are some of the nanotechnology-based assays that emerged for SARS-CoV-2 identification and diagnosis.

Colorimetric assays are a common technique to quantify the analytes, where the absorbance measured at a particular wavelength of the color produced by the indicators like nanosized metallic particles and dye molecules is directly proportional to the analytes’ concentration [80]. Based on this principle, Hanbi Kim et al. proposed a simple, fast, and low-cost effective assay for identifying infectious disease (i.e. MERS) colorimetrically [80]. The technology developed to colorimetrically detect analyte-included modification of using the metallic NPs has been represented (Fig. 5
). The NP-based assay aids in the detection of MERS-CoV, implying the detection range up to 1 pmol/L, signifying its sensitivity of identifying the target at low concentration.Fig. 5Development of a label-free colorimetric assay using gold nanoparticles (Figure adopted from ACS Sensors [80]).Fig. 5

Development of a label-free colorimetric assay using gold nanoparticles (Figure adopted from ACS Sensors [80]).

More recently, Tae Jung Park et al. developed a simple gold binding polypeptides protein approach for the microscale-to nanoscale-controlled immobilization of proteins on a bare gold surface with high selectivity and specificity [81]. By aiding the interaction between two proteins (gold binding polypeptides -fusion proteins) with the help of gold NPs (AuNPs), the detection of an analyte colorimetrically became possible. The binding of the SARS-CoV- E protein to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) mounted on AuNPs leads to considerable alters in the absorbance reading in comparison to the color derived during the GFP- AuNP interaction with a complementary antibody. This enables SARS-CoV quantitative identification.

Furthermore, P. Moitra et al. worked on AuNPs to generate a SARS-CoV-2 detection technology by identifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA. They utilized the complementary binding principle where the NPs were coated with the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which were in turn thiol modified. The antisense oligonucleotides will complementarily bind the target RNA [82]. This colorimetric assay based on the AuNPs’ anisotropic plasmonic features enables targeted binding, bestowing the assay the desired specificity to detect SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 6
).Fig. 6A schematic illustration of antisense oligonucleotide-capped gold nanoparticles) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure adopted from ACS Nano [82]).Fig. 6

A schematic illustration of antisense oligonucleotide-capped gold nanoparticles) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure adopted from ACS Nano [82]).

Guangyu Qiu et al. worked to design a photothermal biosensor with dual-functional plasmonics. It amalgamates the localized surface plasmon resonance and plasmonic photo thermal technologies for sensing to provide a potent approach for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis clinically [71]. The developed biosensor has high sensitivity and selectivity towards the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences and aids in detection capacity at low concentrations, as low as 0.22 pM. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 nano-sensors precision with such technology provides specific identification of the target gene within the multigene pool.

Recently, Jake McClements et al. synthesized molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (NanoMIP) sensors using a short fragment of SARS-CoV-2 [83]. Over antibody-based assays, NanoMIP sensors provide a significant advantage. It efficiently works in challenging media too over the range. To quantitatively detect the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, a thermal test was designed where screen-printed electrodes were utilized, on which NanoMIPS were electrographted. This heat transfer-based setup detected both Alpha and Delta strains’ spike proteins at a very limit of 9.9 fg/mL and 6.1 fg/mL, respectively. This NanoMIP-based detection technique proved to be more sensitive than the antigen test kits available commercially and the other reported antigen assays as well. An assay that can validate the clinical patient’s samples fast (15 min) with great specificity at the comparatively lowest limit is been generated [84].

Apart from colorimetric assays, nano-immunosensors are also nowadays synthesized to detect SARS-CoV-2. Nano-immunosensors are highly sensitive, cost-effective, and capable to be miniaturized. Recently, Laila Ali Layqah and Shimaa Eissa developed a nano-immunosensor, where in a sample, the free virus and MERS-CoV immobilized protein indirectly compete to bind the known, given antibody concentration in the test [85]. This approach is extremely precise, sensitive, and selective, with the ability to detect HCoV (0.4 pg/mL) and MERS-CoV (1.0 pg/mL) [85].

Additionally, Giwan Seo et al. reported a SARS-CoV-2 identifying biosensor as well [86]. This biosensor utilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies, which were coated on the graphene sheets present in the field-effect transistor. This provided the sensor an ability to detect the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at 1 fg/mL and 100 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and clinical transport medium, respectively. This sensor successfully identified 2.42 × 102 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL clinically from 19 patients and 1.6 × 101 pfu/mL in a culture medium [86].

Aptamers are oligonucleotides that can bind specific targets including proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, small molecules, etc., and hence is used as a special class of molecules for a molecular diagnostic and therapeutic purpose [87,88]. Aptamers are advantageous as a recognition molecule, acting as a chemical equivalent of the antibodies as well, the aptamers allow more sensitivity in comparison with the enzyme or antibodies; thus, being preferred for the development of vast arrays of aptamer-based biosensors [89]. The conjugation of the RNA aptamer with the quantum dots and its utilization for rapid and sensitive quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein were demonstrated by Changhyun Roh and Sung Kee Jo at a very less concentration of 0.1 pg/mL [75].

Colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay and enzyme-linked immunoassay were also reported to identify SARS-CoV-2 [90]. With the expeditious nanotechnology development, the BCA has been increasingly utilized for the identification and quantification of a nucleic acid and protein, and target molecules as well as a small molecule, advancing as a new diagnostic tool. The BCA benefits include excellent reproducibility, sensitivity, quick detection time, uncomplicated operation, minimal cost, and a positive association between detection findings [91,92]. The available literature also suggested that using a NPs -based BCA is one of the most potentially practical approaches for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis [[92], [93], [94]].

Nano-based detection strategies for SARS-Cov-2 and related viruses.

The main drawback of anti-viral drugs used for fighting against the virus causing COVID-19 is their non-specificity, which thus tends to be cytotoxic to the host cells. Remdesivir, chloroquine, favipiravir, atazanavir lopinavir/ritonavir, and daclatasvir have been tested in clinical trials as potential therapeutic drugs for SARS and other viral diseases. However, none of these antiviral drugs are definitive cures or suitable prophylaxis [97]. The incorporation of these pharmaceuticals with the nano drug delivery systems can increase the solubility, biodistribution, and half-life of the drug in comparison to the pure drug used as such. Thus, novel therapies are required to combat COVID-19. Nanotechnology has opened up new avenues for developing antiviral therapies [98,99]. NPs are versatile in carrying the drug and targeting viruses, thus availing flexibility in therapeutic delivery. The inactivation of the virus at the host cell entry point may be one of the post-potent mechanisms aided through the usage of NPs to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 spread. More additionally, its enhanced pharmacokinetics and biodistribution features improve the efficacy of currently available antiviral drugs [100,101]. Overall, progress in these approaches makes NPs appealing as a treatment for COVID-19. FDA-approved nanomaterials, including polymeric NPs [102,103], lipid-based NPs [104,105], metallic NPs [106], dendrimers [107], etc. are anticipated to be used to encapsulate antiviral drugs to accomplish long-term circulation, prolong release, and co-delivery of multiple drugs for improved clinical efficiency [108,109].

In recent years, polymeric NPs have gained a lot of attention due to their unique properties resulting from their nanoscale size [110,111]. The NP nano size offers several benefits to it such as its utilization as a promising drug carrier, it avails controlled delivery, aids protection to the bioactive molecules and drugs, and enhances the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy [[112], [113], [114]]. These properties of polymeric NPs can be taken advantage of to minimize the effects of viral infections [115,116]. For many years, researchers have efficiently utilized polymeric materials as antiviral agents, resulting in new classes of materials that hold promise for overcoming these obstacles [117]. It can prevent viral infection and replication by adhering to the penetrating virus and inhibiting its entry into the host cell. Many polymers, synthetic and natural, have been reported as effective antiviral agents [118,119]. Chitosan, dextran, alginates, hyaluronic acid albumin, gelatin, and collagen are some of the natural polymers reported for their antiviral property [120,121]. Synthetic materials such as polyethylene glycol , N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide copolymer, Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly-1-glutamic acid, polystyrene maleic anhydride copolymer are some of the frequently used polymers for nano-drug delivery. Self-assembled copolymers, virus-like polymers, and cell membrane-coated NPs are the different types of polymeric-based nano-drug delivery systems [122,123].

Seo-Yeon Jung et al. developed two forms of MERS-CoV vaccines: (i) spike protein NPs [where S trimers formed high ordered protein–protein micellular NPs] with alum adjuvant and (ii) a MERS-CoV spike gene encoded by a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5/MERS) [124]. The group tested homologous and heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategies using the aforementioned two forms of vaccines. Furthermore, the body weight percent measured with the passing days post-infection stated that there was significantly less weight loss in the Ad5/MERS–spike protein and significantly least weight loss in the spike protein NPs vaccinated group in comparison to the non-vaccinated group post 3 days of infection (Fig. 7
A). The lung histopathology results derived from the vaccinated mice (homologously vaccinated spike protein NPs or a heterologously vaccinated Ad5/MERS spike protein) in comparison to the non-vaccinated controls (PBS and Ad5/GFP) illustrated that the control groups, mice administered with Ad5/GFP and PBS, had the most serious lesions, indicating more a severe MERS-CoV infection, as also derived from the lesion scoring (Fig. 7B and C).Fig. 7To guard against MERS-CoV infection, mice received either heterologous or homologous immunizations with spike protein nanoparticles and Ad5/MERS. (A) To ascertain if the viral infection led to a percentage gain or loss in weight, mice were weighed every day for five days following the vaccination. (B) Non-vaccinated controls (Ad5/green fluorescent protein and PBS) homologously or heterologously vaccinated with Ad5/MERS spike protein test mice groups or spike protein nanoparticles were histopathologically analyzed lesions were scored using their lung sections (C) Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections from lung tissues (Figures adopted from Vaccine, Elsevier [124]).Fig. 7

Henceforth, the heterogeneous vaccination approach using viral vector-based vaccine priming and a protein NP-based vaccine as a booster dose will be most prophylactic to induce efficient immunity towards MERS-CoV infection through the induction of TH1 and TH2, both kinds of immune responses. This study suggests the use of a protein NP-based vaccine as a promising antiviral clinical strategy.

The broad-spectrum antiviral drug, remdesivir, is currently being tested for its potential in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro as well as in vivo. But the clinical results were not so positive [125]. Juanping Wu et al. theoretically designed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor—Lisinopril consisting of Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)NPs—loaded with remdesivir through coupling dissipative particle dynamics simulations and molecular docking (Fig. 8
A). There was a potent interaction observed between remdesivir and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (gthe intracellular target of remdesivir). The results inferred the importance of hydrogen bonding for remdesivir encapsulation. Later on, experimentally, with increasing remdesivir concentration, spherical NPs formation was availed but with higher concentrations precipitation was observed. Thus, the study highlighted the importance and emphasis of a logical framework and prior optimization for designing promising nano-formulations to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection [126].Fig. 83D (A) and 2D (B) conformations of the Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymer and remdesivir binding.

Furthermore, the drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT), have already been clinically tested and have emerged as promising candidates in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro [127,128]. Synergistically, HCQ and AZT have shown more efficiency in reducing viral loads and thus fighting against the SARS-CoV-2 infection results in mortality reduction in comparison to the individual drugs [127,129]. de Barros AO et al. constructed two nanosystems (nanomicelles and polymeric NPs) for the delivery of HCQ and AZT, enhancing their efficacy with reduced side effects [128].

The results revealed a more efficient synergistic impact, indicative even at incredibly low concentrations (0.781 g/mL). The viral multiplication can be significantly reduced, especially in the case of nanomicelles. Both NPs were capable of penetrating the lungs’ interior part and also showed a long retention period (>4 h). AZT and HCQ-loaded polymeric nanosystems have shown to have antiviral effects and were non-cytotoxic in the in-vitro experiments. Therefore, when administered to the lungs, these NPs may provide a safer alternative to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 9
).Fig. 9The schematic diagram illustrates the two nanosystems (polymeric nanoparticles and nano micelles) for the delivery of hydroxychloroquineand azithromycin (Figure adopted from J. Nanostructure Chem. [128]).Fig. 9

Furthermore, IVM, an FDA-approved drug, can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication as its potential in the NPencapsulated form has been proven against the ZIKA virus [130,131]. The study shows that IVM can accumulate in the blood at a higher concentration when it is introduced with a synthetic NP. Additionally, early research demonstrated that IVM delivered with NP can target the ZIKA's non-structural 1 protein. The IVM-loaded NPs increased the antiviral potency by keeping the IVM levels close to the lowest effective therapeutic dose but below the maximum permissible dose.

Recently, Vanna Sanna et al. developed and prepared polymeric NPs for the targeted delivery of antiviral agents such as Remdesivir (RDV) [132]. The RDV-loaded targeted NPs exhibited significantly enhanced antiviral efficacy compared to the free RDV at the same concentration. These findings indicated that by using such a NP-based targeted delivery system, pharmacologically efficient therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection may be improved, paving the way for a cutting-edge and promising treatment for COVID-19 patients.

Hu Tony Y and his research team discussed the impacts of nanomedicine on the efficiency of chloroquine against COVID-19 [133]. They claimed that because of its small size (2–600 nm) and spherical shape, the SARS-CoV-2 protein would behave like a NPand could be taken up by the host cell through a similar endocytosis mechanism. Another drug, Dexamethasone, which is an anti-inflammatory steroid, has been reported in aiding reduction in the number of patient deaths associated with COVID-19 by 35% [134]. It has been proposed that dexamethasone as nanomedicine could aid in the ongoing management of COVID-19 disease. Dexamethasone nano-formulation could have an enhancing effect by boosting its bioavailability and its anti-inflammatory activity over time at the regions of the lungs highly inflamed due to hyper-activated immune cell populations in severely infected areas [135]. Recently, the Swiss company, Bioavanta-Bosti, developed Novochizol™, an aerosol formulation of chitosan NPs that can be used alone or used as a nanocarrier to treat SARS-CoV-2 [136]. Thus, the targeted drug delivery can be efficiently achieved by utilizing polymeric NPs for establishing promising vaccination and treatments to combat SARSCoV-2. The ability to modify several factors is inclusive of the loading capacity, tuning desired viscosity, and achieving shape and size confers polymeric NPs an additional benefit when applied as carriers in the design and the generation of potent SARS-CoV-2 infection treatments.

Metallic NPs are nanosized metals such as gold, silver, iron, etc. with at least one of the dimensions within 1–100 nm. They exhibit unique properties that differ from their bulk counterparts, such as enhanced chemical reactivity, high surface area to volume ratio, and unique optical and electronic properties. These unique properties make metallic NPs useful in a wide range of applications, such as in medicine, catalysis, energy storage, and electronics. The use of metallic NPs as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a research area of interest. Some studies have shown that certain metallic NPs , such as silver and AuNPs , have antiviral properties against the virus. For example, silver NPs have been shown to inactivate the virus by binding to its genetic material and disrupting its replication. However, it is important to note that the use of metallic NPs as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is still in the experimental stage, and more research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety. Inorganic polyphosphate was encapsulated in silica/polyphosphate NPs [137].

LNPs are being injected into the arms of billions of people as COVID-19 mRNA immunizations, fulfilling the promise of nanotechnology to revolutionize drug delivery [138]. In clinical trials, the majority of pharmaceutical companies commonly use liposomes or LNPs as the carrier of the vaccine components to ensure stability and effective cargo delivery. BioNTech and Pfizer have developed the nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®), to combat COVID-19 [139]. BNT162b2 is an mRNA vaccine formulated using LNPs , which showed 95% efficacy in the 3rd phase of the clinical trial. Another company, Moderna, also used the LNPs platform to deliver the vaccine mRNA-1893 [140]. Additionally, LNPs enhance cellular and mucosal absorption while reducing the capacity of mucosal cilia to remove the vaccine system. mRNA molecules can be electrostatically attached to the interior core of a stable nanostructure formed by rapidly mixing lipid NPs and mRNA [141]. This structural characteristic enhances the NPs’ stability in physiological fluids and shields mRNA molecules from nuclease destruction. Modification with polyethylene glycol-lipids prolongs the blood circulation time of NPs and reduces renal filtration clearance and further diminishes the mononuclear phagocyte system recognition [140,142]. Additionally, by further tuning and strengthening the NPs , the targeted bio-distribution of the LNP -mRNA formulations can be enhanced [143].

An antiviral-siRNA treatment has been used to treat several serious human respiratory viruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, RSV, and influenza virus, utilizing mice and non-human primates as model organisms [144,145]. Anti-SARS-CoV2 siRNA therapeutic application is already well-known [146]. The employment of nanocarriers has the potential to significantly improve existing siRNA stability and fragile challenges. Ultimately, these nanocarriers may assist smart delivery systems, which can very efficiently deliver the entire siRNA payload into a desired tissue or organ in the body (Fig. 10
) [147]. Additionally, Poly(ethylene glycol), which has been well studied to stabilize NPs and enhance the in vivo circulation time, could also be used to tune the surface of nanocarriers [148].Fig. 10A schematic representation of the recommended method for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection using nano-carriers having multifunctionality; thus, could fulfill the antiviral siRNA delivery to the respiratory system (Figure adopted from Ref. [147]).Fig. 10

Overall, despite the effective success of nanotechnology-based approaches in SARS-CoV-2 treatment and antiviral therapeutics, there are some concerns about their toxicity and side effects in human body. The nanomaterial has its own pros and cons. In one hand, it acts as a very promising nanocarrier and improves the drug efficacy to prevent virus attachment, fusion, replication, and infection, or even prevent the inflammatory and harmful cascades that occur after a virus infection in patients but on the other hand, there are concerns with respect to its toxicity [149,150]. There are several findings of NPs, particularly the metallic NPs, which show detrimental effects such as mutagenicity, tumorigenicity, production of free radicals, etc. Precautions should be taken into consideration in relation to NP's toxicity, size and dose dependence, delivery method, biodistribution, and biodegradability [151,152] to avoid hazardous effects of nanomaterials on human health. Careful investigations are required to translate the applications of nanomaterials from in-vitro to clinical studies.

The WHO issued several suggestions for COVID-19 prevention and control as the SARS- CoV spreads more swiftly over the world [[153], [154], [155], [156], [157], [158], [159]]. We can prevent viral infections by taking a few steps and implementing them into our daily lives. Potential exposures are managed by a variety of preventive measures in the areas where the COVID-19 virus is being transmitted widely. To control the COVID-19 community spread, temporary lockdown implementation and curfews execution were the first and foremost attempt. Moreover, the areas where a higher number of COVID-19 positive patients have been found were restricted by designating them as containment zones or hot spot locations. Public travel was completely prohibited to stop the further transmission of the virus. The major objective of the preventive measures is to isolate patients who are COVID-19 positive. Maintaining social distancing, frequent hand washing with soap, and carrying along hand sanitizers with 70–95% alcohol could avoid direct contact of the potent virus-infected hands to one’s face and lips.

Two main transmissions are contributing to the widespread COVID-19: (i) human to human physical contact and (ii) through respiratory droplets emitted by the infected person [160,161]. Additionally, hospital environments are one of the serious concerns for potent SARS-CoV-2 spread because of the close contact between medical staff and COVID-19 patients [162,163]. The virus can swiftly be transmitted from the hospital staff members to their families and in the communities. Due to their frequent exposure to the infectious environment, healthcare workers must be protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to reduce the frequency of illnesses and breakouts during the pandemic. Facemasks and gloves have gained widespread acceptance as efficient methods for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 since the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits are also being widely used as a likely promising preventive measure in hospitals. One of the many problems that COVID warriors must handle is the severe skin rashes that can result from the prolonged usage of gloves, PPE, and facemasks, which play the role of COVID-19 preventive wearables [164]. More desirable properties can be inferred from these COVID-19 preventive wearables by implementing nanotechnology in their design and manufacturing. As a result, more cost-effective, smart, hydrophobic, breathable, one with enhanced antimicrobial activity, and effective solutions can be derived as improvement in the existing COVID-19 preventive wearables [[164], [165], [166], [167]].

Applications of nanotechnology in the textile industry for fabrication can confer antimicrobial properties to PPE kits [166]. Metallic nanomaterials such as AgNPs embedded in fabrics have already been proven for their antimicrobial properties [[168], [169], [170]]. AgNPs have also been demonstrated to be used in face masks, lab coats, etc. and have potent antimicrobial functionality [171]. Bhattacharjee Shovon et al. reported that graphene or graphene-based materials can be incorporated into the fabrics, which can further avail special properties like antibacterial, mechanical strength, fire resistance, abrasion resistance capacity, and ultraviolet-protection and can also make it lighter in weight [172] (Fig. 11
).Fig. 11A schematic illustration describing the multiple benefits of graphene-modified protective clothing [172].Fig. 11

A schematic illustration describing the multiple benefits of graphene-modified protective clothing [172].

The hydrophobicity and breathability of the cloth are unaffected by NPs. To strengthen their usage as filters and possible antimicrobial agents, metal NPs like copper and silver can be considered potent options. The silver or copper NPs can be incorporated with the materials like polyester, cotton, cellulose-based fabric, and polyamide [173,174].

Face masks made up of silver and copper NPs -coated dual layer have been developed. Incorporating NPs proves more effective due to virucidal properties of the respiratory face masks [175]. A disposable facemask constructed of cellulose nanofibers and equipped with a filter cartridge developed by Queensland University of Technology, Australia, is capable of filtering particles <100 nm [167]. Furthermore, a reusable mask produced by LIGC Applications Ltd., USA, using a graphene foam with microporosity can capture and thus eliminate pathogenic microorganisms/SARS-CoV-2 due to its conductive electrical charge [176]. Nanofibers were manufactured employing insulation and a block electrospinning procedure [177]. The air filter's pressure was reduced by the orthogonal structure of the nanofibers, which enhanced filtration. The nanofiber-based facemasks have a high filtration capacity, are water-resistant, and remain functional even after multiple washing [178].

Ocular protection is highly important to eliminate the threat of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the eyes of medical professionals and other healthcare workers [[179], [180], [181]]. Natural materials are proven to offer a variety of bioactive qualities, including anticancer, antiviral, and antidiabetic [[112], [113], [114],117]. The 121 amino acid lectin ‘Griffithsin’, which is produced from the red alga Griffithsia spp., has demonstrated antiviral effectiveness against HIV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, etc. It prevents the entry of the aforementioned viruses by interacting with the various glycoproteins on the viral envelope [182]. Despite having great potential, it has some limitations like low bioavailability. Lixiang Wang and Yingping Deng reported that during the SARS-CoV outbreak, medical professionals may benefit from promising ocular protection provided by contact lenses containing Griffithsin NPs by likely preventing the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure [181]. In the present pandemic, the usage of Griffithsin with sustained release in the form of NPs as therapeutic contact lenses can provide promising eye protection from further SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Maintaining good hand hygiene has become a crucial component in the war against coronavirus. A well-accepted principle in the prevention of disease transmission, proper hand hygiene offers a 24–31% possibility of limiting the spread of transmissible disease [183]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises routine hand washing with soap and water for 20 s to stop the spread of viruses; if soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol can be used. Instead of chemical disinfectants, the NPs of metals like silver, titanium, and copper with antiviral properties can be utilized to prevent SARS-CoV2. A multipurpose sanitizer with a nanosilver base that is non-irritating and environmentally friendly has been introduced [177,184]. Additionally, the Italian company Nano, TechSurface, has invented a disinfecting solution consisting of titanium dioxide and silver ions [178]. The nanopolymer-based disinfectants exhibit a potent antibacterial and antiviral action and are simple to manufacture [185]. It has advantages over those based on chemicals as it is economical, non-flammable, and biodegradable.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, biocontamination in various medical equipment and other surfaces are a critical point to be considered and taken care of. Superhydrophobic nanocoatings might be utilized to prevent the transmission of viruses. By dispersing copper NPs in a flexible polymer matrix with the use of a solvent like acetone, super-hydrophobic nanocoatings are generated [186]. Copper NPs also have antibacterial and antiviral properties. Glass surfaces can be nanocoated by using copper and bilayer titanium [187,188]. Since the majority of medical devices are composed of stainless steel, silver NPs have also been used to coat stainless steel surfaces [189].

Almanza-Reyes Horacio et al. synthesized AgNPs and claimed the first-ever study where NPs were utilized as a constituent of the solution used for rinsing the nose and the mouthwash. This aid benefits the healthcare staff directly working in close contact with the person suffering from COVID-19 [190]. According to the study, the use of AgNPs in the mouthwash and nasal rinses can lower the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results derived from this experiment are interesting and promising. The number of COVID-19 patients that the medical staff visited caused them to be exposed to an elevated viral load (each staff member attending an average of 169 patients per week), but in turn did not suffer through SARS-CoV-2 infection. This resistance was a beneficiary result of using AgNPs in the nasal rinse solution and mouthwash [191]. Thus, the utilization of AgNPs in nasal rinsing solutions and the mouthwash would be particularly advantageous as a promising preventive measure for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and its further transmission, not for only healthcare professionals but also the general public. Various nanomaterials used for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection are listed in Table 2

Nanomaterials used for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this article, we have summarized the most recent information available on SARS-CoV-2's origin, morphology, structure, genomic organization, pathophysiology, mode of spread, and symptoms. The current diagnosis and available treatment options along with their limitations were also explored. Here, we have discussed several nanomaterials used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. A nanomaterial offers a myriad of benefits including excellent reproducibility, sensitivity, quick detection time, uncomplicated operation, and minimal cost. Colorimetric assays and nano-immunosensors provide extreme sensitivity and are cost-effective as well. The discipline of nanotechnology has immense potential to provide definitive cure and prevention measures as compared to the limitations faced by the healthcare system. It has paved the way for novel approaches for the sensitive and specific detection system, which has proven to be more precise for identification and diagnosis.

Further, we have discussed several NPs used to enhance the antiviral activity of the already-existing antiviral agents or developing a wholly new antiviral mechanism. Nano-architectured vaccines are considered to be risk-free and 95% effective. For the preventive measurements, we have gone through the SARS-CoV-2 prevention strategies using nanomaterials. The applications of nanotechnology have been explored for bringing out preventive measures. Nanomaterial-modified PPE kits, face masks, gloves, lab coats, etc. can be effectively used for their enhanced antimicrobial properties, cost-effectiveness, better mechanical strength, high conductivity, non-irritating quality, environment-friendly, etc. Synthesized AgNPs are inspected to be highly advantageous as they are considered to be the first NPs that can be used for the mouthwash and nasal rinsing, which subsequently lowers the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection spread.

Henceforth, the swift advancement in the field of nanotechnology seems to be promising; however, to retrieve the fundamental information and improve the present knowledge on nano-medicine and its potential benefits, it should be critically studied and scrutinized. Currently, there are several ongoing clinical trials on their usage that can be tremendously helpful in offering better strategies, in-depth understanding, finer treatment, and preventive measures in an attempt to battle the infectious coronavirus more strongly, specifically, and potently. Researchers would be benefitted from the nanotechnology-based methodologies discussed in this study and aid in generating novel COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment modalities.
