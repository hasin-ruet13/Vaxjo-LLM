Title: COVID-19: An overview of the current pharmacological interventions, vaccines, and clinical trials

In late 2019, there was a sudden surge in the number of individuals being admitted to local hospitals of Wuhan, in the Hubei Province of China, with a pneumonia-like illness of unknown etiology [1]. Although results from preliminary epidemiological investigations pointed towards a zoonotic origin from a local seafood market in Huanan, the exponential increase in the number of cases suggested the possibility of human-to-human transmission [2], [3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of the outbreak by the Chinese authorities on December 31, 2019. By January 7, 2020, scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus from the lower respiratory tract samples of patients who were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan [4]. This pathogen was later termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [5]. The WHO declared this novel viral disease a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and subsequently termed it as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) [6] on February 11, 2020. The first fatality was reported on Jan 11, 2020. The mass migration of people during the Chinese New Year fuelled the rapid spread of the disease to all parts of the globe, which led to the official declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic [7] by the WHO on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has wreaked havoc worldwide, resulting in 15,151,738 confirmed cases and 621,121 deaths across 215 countries and territories [8] as of July 22, 2020. Despite stringent public health measures, the outbreak has continued at a breakneck pace and has laid bare the glaring inadequacies of the present healthcare systems around the world.

Coronaviruses (derived from the Latin word corona, meaning crown) are positive sense, single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses with a diameter of 60 nm to 140 nm, and are widely dispersed in nature [4]. Four (hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) out of the seven species of beta-coronaviruses found in humans cause mild illnesses of the upper respiratory tract such as common cold (also caused by rhinoviruses). Two other kinds, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are considerably more dangerous (mortality rates of 9.6% and 35% respectively [9], [10]). SARS-CoV first emerged in late 2002 in China and spread rapidly to other parts of the world from Hong Kong via air travel. The virus was believed to have originated from a bat (primary host) from where it mutated to infect the intermediate host- Civet cats (a nocturnal mammal sold for meat in China) and subsequently infected humans [11]. It turned into an epidemic with over 8000 cases and 744 deaths [12]. Almost a decade later, MERS emerged in the Middle East with Dromedary Camel as the intermediate host from which it mutated enough to affect humans, resulting in 2494 cases and 858 deaths [13]. SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic factor for COVID-19, is a novel zoonotic RNA betacoronavirus. Several studies have conducted phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 to determine its sequence homology with other viruses of the family Coronaviridae
[4], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shares a 79.6% sequence homology with SARS-CoV, and 96.2% resemblance with bat coronavirus (HKU4) [14]. Fig. 1
depicts the structure of SARS-CoV-2. While the exact source of the virus remains a mystery, it is widely reported to have originated from a bat [4], [14] and made its way to humans via an intermediate animal host, the pangolin [11], [15], a nocturnal mammal that is highly trafficked around the world for the medicinal properties of its scales and its meat. The ecological origin and subsequent transmission of the three aforementioned Coronavirus species are illustrated in Fig. 2
.Fig. 1Diagrammatic representation of the structure of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The figure represents the viral structure of SARS-CoV-2. The spike glycoprotein (S protein) confers a crown like appearance to the virus, hence the name ‘Coronavirus’. The S protein mediates the binding of the virus to cellular receptors. The role of hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in Coronaviruses is poorly understood but it is reported to influence virion attachment in other viruses.Fig. 2Ecological origin and transmission of different species of Coronaviruses. This schematic representation illustrates the ecological origin, different animal hosts, and the subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 to the human population, eventually resulting in the three major epidemics/pandemic of the 21st century.

People of all age groups are susceptible to COVID-19. The symptoms, which have been found to resemble those of the seasonal flu (Influenza), include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia, loss of smell and taste, and dyspnea. Up to 80% of cases are asymptomatic or have mild disease [19]. In some patients, underlying co-morbidities can further exacerbate the diseased condition, leading to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction by the end of the first week, eventually proving fatal.

Inhalation of respiratory droplets generated by symptomatic patients’ cough and sneeze is the main mode of transmission of COVID-19. Infected droplets can spread to distances of up to 2 m and deposit on surfaces, which can act as potential fomites for transmission of the virus to seemingly healthy individuals who touch their mucosa (mouth, nose) and conjunctiva (eyes) without proper sanitization. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people can also spread the infection. The virus is also believed to be present in the stool, and transmission via the feco-oral route cannot be ruled out [20]. There is currently no evidence of transmission of the virus from a pregnant mother to her fetus via transplacental route.

SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable on surfaces like plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 h in favourable atmospheric conditions [21] but is susceptible to common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, diethyl ether, 75% ethanol, chloroform etc [22]. Soap is found to be equally effective since it readily dissolves the lipid bilayer of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 can also be inactivated by UV or when heated at 60 °C for 30 min [23], [24].

Despite being relatively more benign than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the 15 million cases mark worldwide, aided in part by inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. However, the overriding reasons for its exponential growth are the high reproductive ratio (R0) – ranging from 2 to 6.47 [25], the long incubation period of 2 to 14 days (median 5 days) and a Serial Interval (SI) of 5–7.5 days [26], which are indicative of an infectious disease that has the potential of rapidly turning into a pandemic. Sanche et al. recently suggested that the disease had a median R0 of 5.7 (95% CI of 3.8–8.9) and SI of 6–9 days in China during the initial period of the outbreak [27]. In comparison, the R0 of SARS was 2 and 1.3 for the 2009 H1N1 Influenza [26].The mortality rate for COVID-19 ranges between 2 and 5%, with ARDS being the leading cause of death [4].

In the absence of any established pharmacological agents, supportive care remains the cornerstone of clinical management for COVID-19. Prevention involves isolation of suspected cases, home quarantine for the healthy, and the use of effective Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of interpersonal transmission. The conspicuous absence of any proven interventions for COVID-19 [28], coupled with the alarmingly high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 has rendered this pandemic an unmitigated disaster. Swiftly expanding knowledge of the virology of SARS-CoV-2 has laid the groundwork for the identification of effective therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of the disease by providing potential drug targets. This review outlines the measures currently in place to curb its spread and gives a glimpse into the roadmap for the development of a vaccine.

A literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify relevant English-language articles published through July 21, 2020. Search terms included Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Active clinical trials were identified using the search terms COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on ClinicalTrials.gov till July 21, 2020. The search yielded 2713 trials, with 1393 actively recruiting trials specific to COVID-19. Of these, 1174 were observational trials while 1515 were intervention trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Among these, 75 were Phase 4, 350 were Phase 3, 598 were Phase 2, 171 were Phase 1, and 26 were Early Phase 1 trials. 493 trials were not categorized by any particular phase or were not applicable. Further, 228 studies had been listed completed at the time of writing. Results are still awaited for all completed studies.

SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through its Spike (S) protein- a type I surface glycoprotein, and binds to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [29]. ACE2 is a type 1 transmembrane aminopeptidase expressed in the heart and lungs. It negatively regulates the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) and plays a significant role in neurohumoral regulation of the cardiovascular system. When SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it alters the ACE2 signaling pathways, potentially causing acute myocardial and lung injury [30], [31]. ACE2 receptors are abundantly distributed in the epithelia of the lung- especially the alveolar Type II (ATII) cells. Once the virus binds to the receptor, it spreads widely on entering the blood circulation. Fig. 3
shows a schematic representation of the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside a host ATII cell. ACE2 receptors are also said to be present in the liver, digestive organs and kidneys. These tissues and organs could thus be potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 invasion [32]. This explains why many patients with COVID-19 present with extra-pulmonary symptoms [2]. When the over activated immune system is engaged in killing the virus, there is a sharp spike in the production of inflammatory factors, such as IL-2, IL-6, GCSF, MCP-1, TNFα, etc. This, in turn, may pave the way for a cytokine storm [2] and eventually lead to ARDS, secondary infections and multi-organ damage, resulting in death.Fig. 3Schematic representation of the entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cell, its viral lifecycle and potential drug targets. The above-mentioned figure depicts the viral processing of SARS-CoV-2 within host cells. S protein has a major role in binding of the virus to the host receptor cells. It attaches itself to the ACE2 receptor of the human host cell, leading to the release of the viral RNA into the host cell which triggers a cascade that ultimately results in respiratory infection. Select repurposed drugs and their target sites of action are also represented in this schematic. ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; S protein: spike protein; TMPRSS2: type 2 trans-membrane serine protease and IL-6: interleukin 6.

In the months since the novel coronavirus burst onto the scene, drug makers small and large have scrambled to put their best foot forward in an attempt to thwart the pandemic. Some are taking cues from older antivirals, while others are aiming to develop novel therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19. Vaccine development, convalescent plasma therapy, cell-based therapies and monoclonal antibodies are some of the potential approaches being targeted by researchers worldwide. However, drug development is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor with a high attrition rate [33]. The enormity of the current global health emergency means that time is of the essence. Thus, there has been considerable interest in repurposing existing drugs and expediting the development of vaccines, to allow rapid identification of suitable drug candidates. The dearth of proven clinical data on therapeutic agents for COVID-19 has led to a reliance on existing therapies for other viruses such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and HIV etc. It is unclear whether the data from repurposed antiviral drugs can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2, as unlike antibiotics, antivirals are specific for a particular virus in most cases.

lists some of the potential therapeutic agents that have been used as repurposed drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

Potential therapeutic agents as repurposed drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

This table represents a list of repurposed therapeutic agents that are being used for the treatment of COVID-19, their class, mechanism of action, dosage, original target disease, and evidence supporting their use in COVID-19 patients.

Remdesivir, a monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine analog, was originally developed to combat the Ebola outbreak in 2014. It has been highly touted as a potential antiviral drug for COVID-19. It has been shown to have potent in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (EC50 of 0.77 μM [34]), SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [35]. Because of its high selectivity for viral polymerases, Remdesivir is less likely to cause toxicity in humans. The drug also exhibits a high genetic barrier to resistance in coronaviruses and its long intracellular half-life is conducive for once-a-day dosing [36]. There are currently 38 registered trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov for investigating the efficacy of this drug. Preliminary results from a small cohort show clinical improvement in 68% of hospitalized patients [37] on administration of Remdesivir. However, the small sample size and the lack of a control group limit its significance. Wang et al. reported that in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial of 237 participants (NCT04257656), Remdesivir did not exhibit significant clinical benefits [38]. On April 29, the US NIH reported that in a high powered RCT of 1063 participants, patients in the Remdesivir group had shown a 31% faster time to recovery (median 11 days) [39] than those in the placebo group (15 days) (p < 0.001). Even though the findings do not definitively reveal whether the drug is curative, Remdesivir is slated to be the new standard of care [40] for COVID-19 patients in the United States. It has also been approved for therapeutic use in COVID-19 patients by the regulatory bodies of Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Europe [41]. The use of Remdesivir might prove to have a measurable impact on healthcare capacity by minimizing the length of hospital stay and reducing the overall severity of the illness. In a comparative analysis of the Phase 3 SIMPLE-severe trial and a retrospective cohort study of severe COVID-19 patients, Remdesivir has recently shown a 62% reduction in the risk of mortality as opposed to the standard of care and an improvement in clinical recovery [42]. The drug is also being tested on outpatients as an inhaled, nebulised form in a Phase 1a trial [43].

It is an antiviral combination of protease inhibitors that are used to treat HIV infections. Eighty trials are listed on clinical trial registries around the world for testing the drug as a COVID-19 treatment. As Lopinavir has insufficient oral bioavailability (it gets rapidly catabolized by the Cytochrome P450 enzyme system) [44], ritonavir (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) is added to increase its plasma half-life. Even though LPV/r was found to be effective in retrospective studies on SARS-CoV [45], it was far less potent than Remdesivir and Chloroquine in-vitro [46]. In a randomized open-label study of 199 patients with COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000029308), LPV/r failed to reduce overall mortality as well as viral load [47]. Thus it is difficult to ascertain whether LPV/r may have an effective role for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the available data. LPV/r has also been discontinued from randomization in the treatment arms of the RECOVERY trial, and the SOLIDARITY trial as it did not demonstrate any beneficial effect in either clinical recovery or mortality [48], [49].

Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, is frequently prescribed for the treatment of Influenza. It was prescribed to treat flu-like symptoms in COVID-19 patients at the onset of the outbreak in China before SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the etiologic factor. It has no scientific basis for the treatment of COVID-19 as viruses of the Coronaviridae family do not utilize the enzyme neuraminidase. Moreover, Oseltamivir does not exhibit in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV [50]. Eighteen studies are currently listed for testing the drug on COVID-19 patients. Oseltamivir was shown to be ineffective in the treatment of COVID-19 by an in silico assessment, which also included an in vitro and retrospective study [51].

Favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor. It is used in China for the treatment of Influenza and is capable of blocking the replication of other RNA viruses [52] such as arenavirus, filovirus, bunyavirus etc. Favipiravir is activated into its phosphoribosylated form (favipiravir-RTP) in cells, which then inhibits viral RNA polymerase activity [53]. It has shown potential in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 [34]. There are currently 32 studies underway which are aimed at investigating the efficacy of this drug in COVID-19. Favipiravir has been approved for experimental use in COVID-19 patients in Italy, China and Russia [54], [55]. In a recent multicenter trial in Japan, Favipiravir did not show a significant benefit in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases [56].

Ribavirin, a guanosine analog prescribed for viral hemorrhagic fever and respiratory syncytial virus, inhibits viral RNA polymerase and mRNA capping. It has no in-vitro activity against SARS [50], and is far less potent against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro than antivirals like Remdesivir [34]. It is associated with hemolytic anemia which could lead to exacerbation of cardiac disease in co-morbid patients. Further, it is also known to be teratogenic.

It is a protease inhibitor that is used for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Camostat inhibits the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 [57], which primes the viral S protein for entry into human cells. In mice, camostat mesylate showed a 60% survival rate following SARS-CoV infection, at dose concentrations similar to that in humans [58]. It also was found to block viral maturation and entry of SARS-Cov-2 in vitro. Eight trials on COVID-19 are currently underway around the globe.

These are antimalarial drugs which are also believed to have antiviral activity [52]. Both HCQ/CQ demonstrated potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 6.14 μM and 23.90 μM, respectively [59]. The drugs have recently gained notoriety due to much sociopolitical hype that has led to a spate of newly launched clinical trials- more than 240 studies are currently underway around the world. There is very limited data to advocate the use of HCQ/CQ as therapeutic options in COVID-19. In a small open-label non-RCT of 36 patients (20 treated/ 16 controls), significantly improved virologic clearance was observed in the HCQ (N = 14) group. All six patients in the HCQ plus Azithromycin group had significantly better viral clearance [60]. However, six patients in the HCQ group were removed from the study due to adverse effects or intolerance of the medication. A study in Brazil (NCT04323527) was forced to prematurely halt patient recruitment due to the high fatality rate in the CQ group [61]. The authors of the study opined that treatment providers should refrain from administering high doses of CQ to critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards. There was also no reported evidence of a decrease in viral load or improvement in other clinical outcomes. A recent multinational observational study on more than 96,000 patients across six continents reported an increased occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients who received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or in conjunction with macrolides [62]. The authors reported that the drug regimen did not have any beneficial effect on treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients, and exhibited an increased risk of mortality in the treatment group as compared to the control. HCQ/CQ has several potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR), such as the risk of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., QT prolongation), GI Disturbances, ECG abnormalities, hypoglycemia, and retinal damage upon long-term/high dose use. In a recent single-center study on 2541 patients, treatment with HCQ alone and HCQ + Azithromycin demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients [63]. However, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial which tested HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis did not find the drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19 after a high-risk exposure [64]. Hydroxychloroquine was discontinued from the RECOVERY trial owing to no evidence of beneficial effect on either mortality or clinical improvement outcomes [65]. The WHO also discontinued the Hydroxychloroquine trial arm of the SOLIDARITY trial as it did not produce any reduction in mortality of COVID-19 patients when compared to the standard of care [49]. Similarly, the FDA has warned against the use of HCQ/CQ as therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 due to the risk of potential ADRs, and has revoked its status as an emergency-use drug for hospitalized patients who are not enrolled in registered clinical trials [66].

Tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-6 receptors and is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and the “cytokine storm” immune overresponse in cancer patients. IL-6 is implicated in immunologic response in patients with Cytokine-release syndromes (CRS). Elevated levels of IL-6 have been associated with hyperinflammatory states and CRS in severe COVID-19 cases and can potentially lead to increased rates of mortality [67]. Patients with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are at a greater risk of possible ADRs of this drug, which include GI perforation and hepatotoxicity. Sixety two registered trials are currently testing the safety and efficacy of Tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A recent study reported that Tocilizumab improved survival, as well as clinical markers in patients with CRS [68]. The drug was also reported to be associated with lower mortality in a cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients [69]. However, a retrospective cohort study reported that Tocilizumab did not show a significant difference versus standard care in either clinical improvement or mortality [70].

IL-6 Receptor-Inhibiting Monoclonal Antibody that has been previously used in the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis. It is currently being tested in more than fifteen registered trials targeted at managing the “cytokine storm” immune response in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Results from a recent Phase 3 trial showed that Sarilumab did not meet any of the primary or secondary endpoints of the study and is thus ineffective in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation [71].

Ruxolitinib has been found to be effective against inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and is in late-stage development as a topical ointment for atopic dermatitis. Twenty trials are currently testing the efficacy of the drug in COVID-19 patients.

IFX-1 is a monoclonal antibody designed to induce an anti-inflammatory response by blocking the biological activity of human complement factor C5a. One trial (NCT04333420) is currently being held in the Netherlands to test its efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19, with preliminary results expected by December 31, 2020. It will soon be studied in a Phase 3 trial on patients with severe COVID-19 induced pneumonia after promising results in the earlier phases [72].

It is a corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory properties which is prescribed for the treatment of arthritis, and has potential benefit in the management of pneumonia. However, data for its use in severe coronavirus diseases is inconclusive and controversial as it shows no impact on clinical outcomes in SARS [73]. Moreover, the benefits are often outweighed by the risks [74] of secondary infection and delayed viral clearance.

It is a glucocorticoid that has been used for several years in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial have shown that Dexamethasone reduces mortality by one-third in mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, and by one-fifth in patients requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation [75]. The drug did not improve survival in patients not requiring respiratory support. Dexamethasone has been approved for use as a COVID-19 treatment in the UK [76]. As is the case with other corticosteroids, Dexamethasone suppresses the immune system and could thus potentially exacerbate viral infections. However, its immunosuppressant effects might benefit COVID-19 patients who experience CRS.

NKG2D is an activating receptor for the immune system's natural killer (NK) cells. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE-2 receptor using its S protein. By targeting the S protein of the virus and NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE-2 and NKG2D respectively, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 can be eliminated from the infected cells. Moreover, ACE2 CAR-NK cells can competitively inhibit infection of ATII cells by SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2 receptors, thereby preventing the production of infectious virus particles. A multicenter, randomized Phase 1/2 trial (NCT04324996) is currently testing this cell therapy.

RhACE- recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is currently undergoing a Phase-2 clinical trial (NCT04335136) in ALI (Acute Lung Injury) and PAH (Pulmonal arterial hypertension). This synthetic version of the ACE2 is being studied on 200 participants in Austria to determine if it can prevent viral entry and reduce viral replication in COVID-19 patients. Results from the study are expected in November 2020.

These drugs are being trialled to study their cardioprotective effect and prevent direct damage to the heart muscle that appears to exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 in certain patients. The Randomized, open label trial (NCT04333407) will include 3170 patients and will be conducted in the United Kingdom, with a completion date of March 30, 2021.

Inducing passive immunization by infusion of CP is a potential therapeutic option in the absence of a proven anti-viral agent or vaccine. In CP therapy, blood plasma of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 is transfused into patients who are currently ill, in the hope that the freshly-made antibodies will help overcome the virus. Convalescent plasma has previously been used in the treatment of viral diseases such as poliomyelitis, influenza, SARS, and MERS. A case series of five critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS reported clinical improvements after the administration of convalescent plasma [77]. Another study on ten severely ill patients in China showed that the clinical symptoms improved significantly within three days, and that the viral load was undetectable after seven days of transfusion [78]. A recent study on more than 20,000 COVID-19 patients who received CP therapy reported that transfusion of CP is safe and does not heighten the risk of adverse events [79]. The study also indicated a reduction in mortality after transfusion of CP. Ianevski et al. reported on the differential nature of immune reactions to COVID-19 in different patients and suggested that the ability of CP to elicit a neutralizing immune response might wane with time [80]. More than 130 listed trials are in progress across the world to gather stronger evidence that would warrant the use of plasma therapy. Plasma banks for the transfusion of CP from freshly recovered COVID-19 patients have been set up in several countries, including India, to counter the rapidly increasing number of cases [81]. Adverse effects associated with plasma transfusion include pathogen transmission and allergic transfusion reactions. The greatest obstacle for a large scale rollout of plasma therapy is to find prospective donors with high levels of neutralizing antibody titer (>1:640) [78]. Studies on SARS have reported that the level of specific neutralizing antibodies titer decreased rapidly within four months of recovery [82], suggesting that immune protection may wane over time. Such short-lasting humoral immune response suggests that plasma from recently recovered patients is more effective for plasma therapy. The presence of antibodies points to a past infection. However, further research is needed to know more about the type and concentration of virus-neutralizing antibodies that protect against a new infection, and the duration for which the immunity might last. Current data is still insufficient on whether mild or asymptomatic infections generate adequate antibody responses or protection to COVID-19.

Vaccination is the best bet for COVID-19 control. DNA plasmids, epitopes, mRNA, and artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) are some of the biotechnological platforms on which the hunt for a global vaccine is based [83]. Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines for COVID-19. There is limited information on the specific antigens used in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Most candidate vaccines are aimed at inducing neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike (S) protein, which prevents its uptake via the ACE2 receptor. Table 2
provides an overview of the global landscape of COVID-19 vaccine development activity for active clinical trials [84]. The chain of events from conception to market availability of a vaccine usually takes over ten years, and has a mere 6% probability of successful market entry [85]. If a commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were to be made available for use in 12–18 months, assuming its path from the lab to the market is unhindered, it would represent a seismic change from the traditional vaccine development pathway. This would require a multipronged strategy involving novel vaccine development paradigms, flexible development phases, ramping up existing manufacturing capacity, unprecedented scale and speed of global R&D, and radical changes in regulatory processes. It will also require careful evaluation of safety and efficacy every step of the way.Table 2COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently enrolled in active clinical trials.NamePlatformAllocation & MaskingDeveloperClinical Trial StatusStrengthTrial LocationEstimated Date of CompletionReferencesmRNA 1273Lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA vaccine encoding S protein.Randomized; Double blindModerna/National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases (NIAID)Phase II trial (NCT04405076)600United StatesAugust 2021[83], [84]Lentiviral Minigene Vaccines (LV-SMENP-DC)Lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) used to modify dendritic cells (DCs) and to activate T cells.Non-Randomized; Open LabelShenzhen Geno-Immune Medical InstitutePhase I (NCT04276896)100Shenzen, ChinaDecember 31, 2024Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) live-attenuated vaccine*Live-attenuated vaccine that induces a broad immune-system response.Randomized; Open LabelANDRandomized; QuadrupleMurdoch Children's Research Institute;AndUMC UtrechtPhase III BRACE trial - (NCT04327206)ANDPhase III BCG-CORONA trial - (NCT04328441)4,170 (Australia)AND1500 (Netherlands)AustraliaANDThe NetherlandsMarch 30, 2022ANDDecember 25, 2020INO-4800DNA plasmid vaccine.Non-Randomized; Open LabelInovio PharmaceuticalsANDCoalition For Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)Phase I (NCT04336410)40Philadelphia and Kansas City, USAApril 2021AD5-nCovRecombinant non-replicating viral vector vaccine.

Interventional trials on COVID-19 listed as completed on ClinicalTrials.gov.

This table looks at the interventional trials that have been completed and listed on ClinicalTrials.gov.

The SOLIDARITY trial is an international collaborative clinical trial initiated by the WHO to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19 in over 100 countries. The trial will assess the efficacy of four treatment options against COVID-19, namely: Remdesivir; LPV/r; LPV/r with Interferon β-1a; and HCQ/CQ. Trial arms in multiple countries will help expedite the results to rapidly discover whether any of the drugs are effective against SARS-COV-2 [87]. The WHO recently brought the HCQ arm of the SOLIDARITY trial to a halt [88] after reports of a higher mortality rate and an increased risk of adverse effects in patients who received the drug [62] came to light.

DISCOVERY (NCT04315948) – a multi-centre, adaptive, randomized, open label clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of treatments of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults, was initiated by the French Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) as the European counterpart of the SOLIDARITY trial, with the same treatment regimen. The study will be conducted on 3100 patients in seven countries across Europe [89].

The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of over 11,000 patients across the UK. The treatment arms include LPV/r (discontinued due to lack of efficacy), Dexamethasone, HCQ (discontinued), Azithromycin, Tocilizumab, and Convalescent plasma [48].

In order to understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, vigilant follow-up of those recovering from the disease is needed. Previous respiratory diseases brought about by coronaviruses have resulted in deranged lipid and glucose metabolism as well as cardiovascular issues in recovered individuals for up to 12 years [90]. Widescale serology testing of recovered individuals for the identification of antibodies is key to developing a broader understanding of the disease dynamics of COVID-19. It will also shed light on the neutralizing antibodies, which could potentially act as templates for monoclonal antibody therapies and vaccine candidates in the near future. New diagnostic modalities, serological tests, contact-tracing technologies and disease surveillance tools are essential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and help prepare for future outbreaks with better preparation and preventive measures.

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of the current study. First, the review only included studies conducted on individuals aged 18 or above. Thus, findings from the studies might not always be generalizable to the pediatric population. Second, the search was limited to only English-language articles which might have been a bottleneck because much of the early data on COVID-19 came from studies which were based in China.

In summary, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious novel coronavirus that has rapidly brought about a global pandemic, destroying lives and livelihood at an alarming pace. Even though much is known about its genetic sequence and virology due to our knowledge of its predecessors, several questions regarding the epidemiological properties, transmission and pathogenesis remain unanswered. Animal studies and clinical trials on therapeutics directed against immunopathologic host responses are needed to elucidate the full spectrum of damage caused by this pathogen. Repurposing of existing drugs and the use of non-pharmacological therapies such as Convalescent Plasma are currently the best treatment avenues until a safe and efficacious vaccine is discovered. Although certain prospective agents listed in this review are promising, definitive evidence regarding their effectiveness remains inconclusive. COVID-19 has emerged to be a formidable adversary to the very existence of life as we know it. Overcoming these tough times requires the concerted efforts of people from all walks of life. It necessitates extensive international collaboration between academia, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, policymakers, public health organizations and philanthropic associations. The onus on coordinated technical and financial resource mobilization has never been higher, and is indispensable if we are to get the better of this pandemic.
