Title: RETRACTED ARTICLE: Potential use of
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition and prevention method
in viral infection

Lipids are a substantial and heterogeneous category of biomolecules
crucial to the pathophysiology and physiology of cells. In general, it is believed
that lipids serve three primary functions within a cell. To begin with, polar lipids
constitute the matrix of membranes and enable tubulation, fusion, budding, and
fission of cellular and organelle membranes. Furthermore, certain lipids facilitate
the development of lipid rafts, which are exceptionally well-organized areas of the
plasma membrane and play a crucial role in receptor signaling processes. Secondly,
lipids have signaling functions during infection and inflammation and can function
as first and second mediators in molecular recognition and signal transduction
processes. Fatty acids may ultimately be encapsulated in lipid droplets (LDs), which
serve as energy storage mediums. The principal constituents of LDs are triglycerides
(TGs) and sterol esters (sterols esterified by a fatty acyl chain). These droplets
function as energy stores for the host cell during periods of nutrient scarcity
[1]. Furthermore, cholesterol is
distributed into accessible and isolated compartments inside cell membranes.
Variation in red blood cells (RBCs) cholesterol accessibility was not linked to the
cholesterol levels in RBCs or plasma. Still, it was connected to the phospholipid
makeup of RBC membranes and plasma triglyceride levels. Around half of the
cholesterol in the bloodstream is transported in RBC membranes. Studies using
tracers in people show that the amount of cholesterol passing through RBC is similar
to the total release of free cholesterol from tissues [2]. Aside from lesions, cholesterol levels are crucial in several
immune cell functions, including monocyte priming, neutrophil activation,
hematopoietic stem cell mobilization, and increased T cell generation. Changes in
cholesterol intracellular metabolic enzymes or transporters in immune cells might
influence their signaling and phenotypic differentiation, thereby affecting the
development of atherosclerosis [3].
Platelets participate in both the initiation of the vascular inflammatory response
during the progression of atherosclerosis and the promotion of thrombus formation
after the rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque. Platelets that have been activated
adhere not only to the impaired endothelium but also to that which is intact or only
marginally affected, thereby exacerbating thrombotic and inflammatory processes.
LDL, in turn, recruits inflammatory cells to the sub-endothelium and induces
prothrombotic alterations on the endothelial cell surface, thereby contributing to
the early phase of atherosclerosis. Platelets, endothelial cells, macrophages, and
others are all implicated in the oxidized (ox)-LDL formation process. Ox-LDL is
defined as “circulating LDL-derived particles that are accompanied by
peroxides or byproducts of their degradation.” ox-LDL-LDL, as opposed to LDL,
exerts direct prothrombotic effects via functional interactions with platelets,
thereby stimulating platelet activation and promoting thrombus formation
[4]. Hypercholesterolemia and
cholesterol buildup in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) cause an increase in monocyte
production, leading to their accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques. This is
counteracted by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and cholesterol removal pathways.
Cholesterol buildup in the plasma membrane of HSCs in the bone marrow enhances the
expression and signaling of growth factor receptors, leading to the proliferation of
these cell types and the heightened generation of monocytes, neutrophils, and
platelets [5]. Long recognized is the
significance of cellular lipids in viral infection, specifically membrane fusion and
virion envelopment during particle maturation and entry, respectively. Recently,
researchers understanding of the functions of lipids in viral infection has
broadened significantly. It is now understood that lipids coordinate the subcellular
localization of critical viral life cycle events. Viruses encode proteins that
remodel the host cell by emulating lipid signaling and synthesis machinery. In
addition to generating lipids for envelopment, this process establishes protected
replication sites [6]. The production of
virions necessitates a complete reorganization of the biosynthesis apparatus, which
typically entails significant alterations to the lipidome of the cell [7]. A lot of attention has been paid to
cholesterol because it is an important fat in the life cycle of almost all viruses.
These groups seem to have devised several different ways to control cholesterol
metabolism in the direction of lipid absorption and de novo production [8]. Cholesterol is an essential component in
maintaining lipid or membrane rafts, which are distinct structures found on the cell
membrane. Among the many cellular processes in which cholesterol is involved is
regulating virus entry into the host cell. It has been demonstrated that cholesterol
is required for virus entry and/or morphogenesis by several viruses. Scholarly
investigations suggest that alterations in the lipid metabolism of the host are
linked to infections caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
as chronic hepatitis-causing viruses progress to severe liver disease [9]. In addition to its demonstrated significance
in virus emergence, cholesterol has also been implicated in virus entry. Cholesterol
must be present in the membrane of the target endosome for the Semliki Forest virus
to fuse. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and herpes simplex virus can’t
enter cells without cholesterol. This is true for both the target membrane (plasma)
and the source membrane (viral envelope). Other viruses, like the nonenveloped
polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40), get into cells through caveolae. These viruses
depend on the cholesterol-containing lipid microdomains of the cell to do their work
[10]. A wide range of viruses can
cause cholesterol anabolism, which means that affected cells go through a general
change toward taking in cholesterol and making it from scratch. Sterol-regulatory
element-binding proteins (SREBPs) control many important biological processes by
controlling how they are copied. Along with sterols, these ER-resident proteins stay
in a group with insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) and SREBP cleaving-activating
protein (SCAP). When the Golgi apparatus runs out, INSIG1 breaks apart, and the
SREBP-SCAP complex moves to it. The transcription factor (TF) region is freed after
breakage and can be taken into the nucleus. The activity of many genes that add to
the buildup of cellular cholesterol is controlled by SREBPs. The low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase
(HMGCR) are two important parts. HMGCR speeds up the process of making cholesterol
and binds to the main lipoprotein that carries cholesterol. Multiple pathogens
target this point of control and seize it. SREBP activity is stimulated by human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV), HBV, or HCV via the enhancement of its proteolytic cleavage
[8, 11]. Cholesterol-modifying drugs can impede the activities of
critical rate-limiting enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, and SREBP proteins that
control cholesterol homeostasis in the host. This results in an impact on the entry
of coronaviruses, fusion of membranes, and formation of pathological syncytia.
Consequently, these drugs exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral effects. Therefore,
cholesterol metabolism disorder is a complex issue that has both positive and
negative consequences. While it disrupts regular cellular physiological processes,
it can impede coronavirus replication by exploiting cholesterol dysregulation in
localized cellular environments like lipid rafts or endosomes. Also, for the early
stages of coronavirus infection, making medicines that change cholesterol and target
important parts of affected cells like lipid rafts and endosomes could be a good way
to fight the virus [7, 12].

PCSK9, a circulating proprotein subtilisin kexin type 9, makes it harder
for LDL to be cleared by breaking down the LDL receptor (LDLR). PCSK9 is a new drug
target for treating high cholesterol, and different PCSK9 inhibitors are currently
being tested in human studies [13]
(Fig. 1). The cyclase-associated
protein-1 (CAP-1) has been found to bind to PCSK9. It is thought to be necessary for
PCSK9 to break down LDLR. The catalytic domain of PCSK9 binds to LDLR, but it looks
like the CHRD of PCSK9 can also connect with CAP1. This makes it easier for the
lysosomes to break down the protein complex LDLR/PCSK9/CAP1 through a
caveolin-dependent process [14]. PCSK9
may change plasma lipids by focusing on other LDLR family members, such as apoE
receptor 2 (apoER2), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, and LDLR-related
protein 1. It can also change the amount of LDL in the liver and the uptake of
LDL-C. This conclusion is supported by the protein’s ability to operate via
multiple cellular pathways. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the degradation of
these receptors may not occur as a result of the PCSK9 interaction, at least not
across all tissues [15–17]. Later
research showed that PCSK9 controls the recycling of LDLR and found that PCSK9
loss-of-function versions are linked to a lower risk of coronary heart disease and
low amounts of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in the blood. It was rapid to make monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) that target PCSK9 and test them in clinical studies. Plasma LDL-C
levels were reduced by around 60% when PCSK9 inhibitors were administered,
even to patients already receiving maximum-dose statin therapy. Three cardiovascular
outcome trials concluded within the previous year, demonstrating that PCSK9
inhibitors reduce the risk of severe vascular events by a substantial margin.
Positively, this advantage does not appear to be accompanied by significant
compensatory adverse effects, including an overabundance of myalgias, an increase in
plasma levels of hepatic aminotransferases, incident diabetes mellitus, or
neurocognitive adverse events. An exceptional decrease in LDL-C levels was the
therapeutic benefit shown in studies with PCSK9 inhibitors, suggesting that more
aggressive goals for LDL-C should be sought [18]. Studies using PCSK9 inhibitors have shown a remarkable
therapeutic benefit—a reduction in LDL-C levels—suggesting the need
for more stringent LDL-C targets [19]
(Fig. 2). More and more evidence
points to PCSK9’s role in the development of viral infections, including HCV,
and in the regulation of the host’s immune response to bacterial infections,
especially sepsis and septic shock. Researchers have identified PCSK9 function as a
critical component in malaria initiation and progression. Preclinical research
suggests that PCSK9 suppresses HCV replication, which adds to the current interest
in treating hyperlipidemia linked with HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) by
inhibiting PCSK9 in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, PCSK9 inhibition has been
suggested to protect against dengue virus (DENV) potentially and severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses. Surprisingly, elevated
levels of PCSK9 in the plasma have been reported among sepsis patients. Finally, it
has been reported that a loss of function in the PCSK9-encoding gene may reduce
malaria infection mortality [20]. Even
though LDLR uptake would have spread cholesterol around the cell, de novo
cholesterol synthesis raised endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cholesterol levels, which
stopped the phosphorylation of tank-binding kinase (TBK) and the stimulator of the
IFN gene (STING) when DENV was present. TBK and STING were not activated as much,
which decreased the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) and the antiviral
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that work after IFN. In DENV patients, clinical
data showed a direct link between higher plasma PCSK9 levels and higher viral loads
and worsening disease, which supported the results from the lab. These results also
show that PCSK9 is a host factor for DENV in target cells that live in low-oxygen
conditions and that blocking PCSK9 is effective [21].

Our research aimed to explore the many aspects of PCSK9 concerning lipid
control. Lastly, we looked at how various viral infections affect PCSK9’s
function in lipid control. So, our research suggests that PCSK9 is involved in
developing viral infections. Vaccinations and drugs that block PCSK9 might
effectively treat viral infections in hosts.

Fig. 1There is a signal peptide (amino acids 1 to 30), a prodomain
(amino acids 31 to 152), a catalytic domain (amino acids 153 to
452), and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 453 to 692) that make up
the mature form of PCSK9. The signal peptide breaks apart when it
gets to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the PCSK9 zymogen is
automatically made between Gln152 and Ser153
(serine-isoleucine-proline
(SIP)/valine-phenylalanine-alanine-glutamine (VFAQ)152). Furin
enzymes turn off the adult version of PCSK9, which is about
60 kDa long (aa 153 to 692). This makes it shorter, to
55 kDa. The orange boxed area shows the signal peptide (SP),

Fig. 2How lipoproteins are broken down in reaction to treatments
that target PCSK9. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) attach to the
PCSK9 mRNA and stop it from being made. 2. Small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) stop the production of PCSK9 by encouraging the breakdown
of PCSK9 mRNA. 3. Small molecule inhibitors stop PCSK9 from
activating and being released from the ER, which is an essential
step in the maturation process. 4. LDLR can’t connect with
PCSK9 because of small peptides that look like the structure of
PCSK9’s catalytic domain, C-terminal domain, or epidermal
growth factor precursor homology domain-A. 5. Bancovirus monoclonal
antibodies stop PCSK9 from attaching to LDLRs. Therapies that target
PCSK9 improve the clearance of LDL particles through receptors by
stopping LDLRs from breaking down. This encourages LDLR to return to
the cell surface. Proteins that are special to PCSK9 and create
higher-than-normal amounts of LDLRs may help explain why treatment
causes lower levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). A recent study backs
up this theory [23,
24]

Mammalian cell membranes cannot function without cholesterol, also a
building block for essential signaling molecules [25]. In the ER, cholesterol inhibits both receptor-mediated
absorption of LDL and cholesterol production. Cholesterol content in membranes and
the locations of cholesterol deposition in cells are essential regulators.
Cholesterol production mainly occurs in ER, which also contains enzymes and
regulatory proteins such as HMG-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element binding
protein (SREBP) precursors, and cyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which
are either activated or repressed by cholesterol. Cholesterol levels in ER are lower
than those in the plasma membrane (PM), which comprises 60–90% of the
cholesterol in cells [26, 27]. Two main areas have focused on the role of
cholesterol in virus-host cell interactions: first, directly, because viruses are
believed to preferentially partition themselves into cholesterol-rich lipid domains
called “lipid rafts” during entry, and second, indirectly, because
viral infection modifies cellular biosynthetic pathways [28]. A key component of viral entrance into host
cells is the presence of lipid rafts, which are subdomains of the plasma membrane
rich in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. Many believe that the high cholesterol
levels seen in lipid rafts are crucial for the viral infection process [29–31].
Cholesterol is essential for HIV replication because the virus enters and exits
target cells via lipid rafts, cholesterol-laden regions of the plasma membrane
[32].

Moreover, the assembly of hepatic VLDL is essential for virus
production, and circulating virions are complexed with lipoproteins; these complexes
are known as lipoviral particles. Multiple functional roles have been attributed to
the formation of these complexes, as supported by evidence. These roles include
co-opting lipoprotein receptors to facilitate attachment and entrance, concealing
epitopes to aid immune evasion, and hijacking host factors to facilitate HCV
maturation and secretion [33]. The
observed anti-HCV effects of statins seem to be attributed to their ability to
inhibit the synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, as opposed to their
cholesterol-lowering properties. Additional compounds that inhibit different stages
of cholesterol metabolic pathways have been investigated to develop novel approaches
for eradicating this virus [34]. It has
been documented that HCV RNA replication occurs in conjunction with
detergent-resistant membranes, which are thought to contain an abundance of
unesterified/free cholesterol and sphingolipids [11]. Multiple cellular receptors, including the CD81 receptor,
the scavenger receptor class B type I receptor, and the LDLR, have been suggested to
facilitate the entrance of HCV into cells. It has been established that the
expression of the LDLR gene in human mononuclear cells is coordinated and
synchronized with that of the gene in the human liver. A correlation between LDLR
expression and HCV viral load may indicate that the LDLR is involved in the HCV
replication cycle in human subjects [35] (Table 1).

Table 1The role of LDLR in several viral infectionsViral infectionExplain LDLR functionRefHCVThe LDLR has been suggested to facilitate the
entrance of HCV into cells. It has been established that the
expression of the LDLR gene in human mononuclear cells is
coordinated and synchronized with that of the gene in the
human liver. A correlation between LDLR expression and HCV
viral load may indicate that the LDLR is involved in the HCV
replication cycle in human subjects. [35]HBVLDLR binds to the apoE associated with HBV and
functions as an HBV cell attachment receptor. When
administered during HBV infection, but not subsequently, the
LDLR-blocking monoclonal antibody C7 suppressed HBV
infection, indicating that its activity happened very early
in the HBV infection process. [36]SARS-CoV-2Lentiviral pseudovirions coated with SARS-CoV-2
spike protein can enter ARPE-19, a human retinal pigment
epithelium cell line, in a laboratory setting. This entry
process can be hindered by specific antibodies,
cholesterol-depleting agents, and siRNAs targeting LDLR.
Researchers’ hypothesis suggests that caveolae and
LDLR receptors within caveolae play a role in the
receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism utilized by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect particular tissues, such as
ocular cells. [37]HIVLDLR levels in mononuclear cells of the liver and
blood are down-regulated in HIV-positive patients with
lipodystrophy, independent of PI-ART, compared to
HIV-negative controls and positive patients without
lipodystrophy. [38,
39]Dengue virusFor DENV to proliferate and be introduced,
cholesterol is essential. Furthermore, it was shown that
soon after infection, there was an increase in lipid raft
formation and total cholesterol levels. This improvement is
linked to decreased HMGCR phosphorylation and increased LDLR
levels on the surface of infected Huh-7 cells. [40]Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus
(CCHFV)The LDLR is an essential entry receptor for CCHFV
infection. By employing biochemical, cellular, and genetic
methodologies, we provide evidence that CCHFV Gc forms a
direct association with LDLR, a critical factor in
facilitating its entry into diverse cell types ranging from
mouse to human, and ensuring successful infection and
pathogenesis in mice. [41]Zika (ZIKV), Yellow Fever (YFV),and West Nile (WNV) virusBy manipulating host cholesterol levels during
infection with DENV, ZIKV, YFV, and WNV, interferon type I
response regulation, viral entry, and the assembly, egress,
and formation of replicative complexes are all enhanced.
Virus particles establish a connection with the cell surface
and bind to receptors located in lipid rafts, which are
cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane. This
procedure initiates endocytosis dependent on clathrin. Upon
attachment and entry, the infected cell’s surface
demonstrates an immediate increase in cholesterol levels,
associated with a rise in LDLR. [42]

While genetic and interventional research has shown that reducing PCSK9
levels is associated with cardiovascular benefits, identifying processes unrelated
to cholesterol has occurred since PCSK9’s discovery. The goal of this review
is to give a full explanation of PCSK9’s pathophysiology and possible
non-lipid-lowering effects that have been studied in depth (for example, the
inflammatory burden of atherosclerosis, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism,
and platelet activation) or are still to be understood (for example, in adipose
tissue). Finding regulatory factors in the promoter region of human PCSK9 (like
Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP)) sheds light on new
processes. This means that controlling intrahepatic glucose could be a part of
treatment methods to lower cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes.
Finally, the fact that PCSK9 is involved in both cell growth and death suggests that
this protein may play a part in cancer development [22].

An instance of this was when PCSK9 expression was discovered to be
upregulated in tissues of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and
patients with HNSCC who had higher PCSK9 expression had an inferior prognosis. In a
manner dependent on LDLR, researchers additionally discovered that pharmacological
inhibition or siRNA downregulation of PCSK9 expression inhibited the stemness-like
phenotype of cancer cells. Furthermore, in a mouse model bearing a 4MOSC1 syngeneic
tumor, PCSK9 inhibition increased the infiltration of CD8 + T
cells, decreased the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and
improved the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)) immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. PCSK9, a conventional target for
hypercholesterolemia, may serve as an innovative biomarker and therapeutic target to
augment ICB therapy in HNSCC, according to these findings [43]. The study’s goal was to find out if
PCSK9 levels in tumor tissue could help predict how well advanced non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) would respond to anti-PD-1 treatment and if the PCSK9 inhibitor
and anti-CD137 agonist could work together to fight tumors. Anti-PD-1 treatment
didn’t work as well in people with advanced NSCLC because their background
tumor cells had higher levels of PCSK9. By mixing the anti-CD137 agonist with the
PCSK9 inhibitor, it might be possible to get rid of Tregs and get more
CD8 + and
GzmB + CD8 + T cells to join the process.
This could be a new way to treat people that will be used in future studies and
clinical practice [44]
(Fig. 3).

Fig. 3Potential mechanisms contributing to increased cholesterol
availability for cancer cells. PCSK9 is closely associated with the
incidence and progression of several cancers. In several studies,
PCSK9 siRNA was shown to effectively suppress the proliferation and
invasion of several studied tumor cells. Cancer cell’s demand
for cholesterol is supplied by both uptake from the blood or de novo
synthesis. Therefore, high plasma cholesterol may provide such a
high cancer cell requirement. On the other hand, oxidized
cholesterol derivatives, namely oxysterols, show a significant
apoptotic effect, thus opposing cancer cell proliferation

Globally, injectable PCSK9 monoclonal antibody or siRNA is presently
employed in clinics for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia; it has the potential
to be combined with established cancer/metastasis therapies. Researchers conduct
additional research to elucidate the functional mechanisms underpinning the
modulation of LDL-C and to identify the novel functions that PCSK9 is developing in
both healthy and diseased conditions [46]. Treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors has been shown to reduce
LDL-C by inhibiting LDLR, to have an antiviral effect on HCV infection by decreasing
the surface expression of LDLR and CD81 on hepatic cells, and to be positively
associated with increased inflammatory responses and septic shock through the
downregulation of hepatocyte LDLR, according to data gathered from clinical trials.
However, therapeutic entirely humanized antibodies that inhibit PCSK9 effectively
reduce elevated LDL-C levels [47].
Several membrane-bound receptors, including ApoER2, the hepatocyte LDLR, and the
very LDLR, are known to be degraded by human PCSK9. Since it is believed that the
LDLR is involved in HCV entrance, researchers also looked at how PCSK9 may affect
the levels of CD81, a primary HCV receptor. The expression of CD81 and LDLR was
markedly reduced in cells that expressed stable PCSK9 or PCSK9-ACE2, an active
version of the protein linked to the membrane. Therefore, the effectiveness of PCSK9
as an antiviral agent was evaluated in vitro by applying it to the HCV genotype 2a
(JFH1) virus. It was shown by the findings that cells expressing PCSK9 or
PCSK9-ACE2, but not the control protein ACE2, were resistant to HCV infection.
Purified soluble PCSK9 reduced HCV infection dose-dependently when added to cell
culture supernatant. It was expected that HuH7 cells expressing PCSK9-ACE2 would be
resistant to infection with HCV pseudoparticles. In addition, it was shown that
PCSK9 regulates CD81 cell surface expression independently of LDLR. The livers of
mice that were either single- or double-knockout for PCSK9 and LDLR showed
significantly reduced amounts of both proteins, although levels of transferrin and
scavenger receptor class B type 1 remained unchanged. Hence, they postulate that
PCSK9 plasma levels and/or activity may regulate human HCV infectiousness
[48] (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4The PCSK9 effect on HCV. Numerous host factors, including
heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), low-density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR), tetraspanin CD81, claudin-1 (CLDN1), occludin
(OCLN), tight junction proteins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
and the Niemann–Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), are implicated in
HCV entry into human hepatocytes. Activation of fatty acid and
cholesterol synthesis throughout the HCV life cycle. Throughout its
replicative life cycle, HCV fosters a lipid-rich environment by
stimulating the expression of transcription factors that are
involved in the production of cholesterol and fatty acids.
Additionally, HCV increases LDLR expression on the surface of
hepatocytes to facilitate entry. Microsomal triglyceride transfer
protein (MTP) downregulation further inhibits the excretion of VLDL
by HCV [33,
49]

By inhibiting its principal protease, statins might exert a direct
antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2. Potential benefits include up-regulation of
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) induced by statins. At the same time,
cholesterol reduction may effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by impeding its replication
or preventing its entrance into host cells via disruption of lipid rafts. Existing
human investigations have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibitors and statins are
beneficial in treating sepsis and pneumonia. These medications have the potential to
function as immunomodulators against severe complications of COVID-19, including
cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Generally,
randomized clinical trials are required before statins and PCSK9 inhibitors can be
used routinely to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the interim, unless otherwise
indicated, it is advised that lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) not be discontinued in
COVID-19 patients [50]. In COVID-19
instances, there is a negative correlation between the degree of inflammation and
the prognosis. PCSK9 regulates LDLR homeostasis and may influence vascular
inflammation and the COVID-19 inflammatory response. The main secondary result was
the change in IL-6 levels in the blood at 7 and 30 days after the start of the
study. Patients who were randomly assigned to receive the PCSK9 inhibitor had lower
rates of death and needed to be tubed within 30 days compared to those who received
the placebo. IL-6 levels in the blood dropped by 56% over time with the PCSK9
inhibitor compared to the control (30-day drop vs. − 21%).
Patients whose IL-6 levels were higher than the norm at the start of the study had a
lower chance of dying when PCSK9 suppression was used instead of a dummy. In severe
COVID-19, PCSK9 inhibition decreased IL-6 levels and was the primary endpoint of
mortality or intubation need, compared to placebo [51]. Furin, a convertase, is required for SARS-CoV-2 to infect
others because it needs to cut its spike protein (S) at two locations, S1/S2 and
S2′. PCSK9 reduced cell-to-cell fusion by making it easier for ACE2 to break
down in cells, while subtilisin-kexin isozyme 1 (SKI-1) increased cell-to-cell
fusion by making SREBP-2 more active. The increased S2′ formation induced by
SKI-1 activity was ascribed to heightened metalloprotease activity mediated by
activated SREBP-2 in response to elevated cholesterol levels. Then, researchers
provided evidence that PCSK9 facilitated the cellular degradation of ACE2, which
consequently decreased cell-to-cell fusion. In contrast to the canonical target of
PCSK9, the LDLR, the PCSK9-induced degradation of ACE2 does not require the
C-terminal Cys-His-rich Domain (CHRD) domain. Modeling at the molecular level
indicated that ACE2 binds to the Pro/Catalytic domains of mature PCSK9. Thus,
SARS-CoV-2 entrance can be modulated by the cholesterol-regulating convertases PCSK9
and SKI-1 via two distinct mechanisms [52]. Plasma PCSK9 levels were significantly elevated in our 156
patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis compared to
the 68 healthy controls, according to the last studies. Plasma PCSK9 levels did not
exhibit a correlation with C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, or procalcitonin in
either of the sub-cohorts. In patients with SIRS/sepsis who underwent ventilation
and those who did not, plasma PCSK9 levels did not differ significantly between the
two groups. In addition, there was no significant correlation between vasopressor
therapy and changes in plasma PCSK9 levels. Patients with Gram-negative and
Gram-positive infections in the non-COVID-19 SIRS/sepsis group exhibited comparable
plasma PCSK9 levels to those without any discernible pathogen in their bloodstream
[53] (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5Through a mechanism that requires only the
prodomain/catalytic subunit of mature PCSK9 to bind ACE2,
extracellular PCSK9 promotes the degradation of ACE2. This mechanism
likely reduces ACE2 levels on the cell surface, inhibits
cell-to-cell fusion, and potentially mitigates SARS-CoV-2 infection.
This figure illustrates how extracellular PCSK9, and its
gain-of-function variant D374Y in particular, substantially enhanced
the degradation of ACE2. Necessary for the transportation of the
PCSK9-LDLR complex to endosomes/lysosomes for degradation is the
CHRD domain of PCSK9, particularly its M2 module. Surprisingly, the
catalytic and/or prodomain of PCSK9 appear to be the critical
domains for PCSK9 activity on ACE2, not the CHRD; this distinguishes
ACE2 as a unique and novel PCSK9 target, quite distinct from the
LDLR and MHC-I, which may partially explain this observation

During DENV infection, ER-resident STING and type I IFN activation was
inhibited due to cholesterol enrichment in the ER. Additional evidence corroborated
researchers’ in vitro results by identifying heightened plasma PCSK9
concentrations in DENV patients exhibiting severe plasma leakage and high viremia.
Hence, their results indicate that PCSK9 may have an unidentified function in the
pathogenesis of DENV and that inhibitors of PCSK9 may serve as an effective
host-directed therapy for DENV patients [54]. The unforeseen significance of PCSK9 in developing DENV
prompted researchers to examine the efficacy of alirocumab, an inhibitory PCSK9-mAb,
in impeding PCSK9 activity. As expected, this treatment led to increased levels of
LDLR and decreased levels of viremia. Further comprehensive clinical investigations
are required to substantiate the potential efficacy of PCSK9 inhibition in managing
DENV infections and to assess the treatment’s long-term antiviral impact
[46]. In these microenvironments,
inflammation induced by an infection, including DENV, can worsen hypoxia due to the
further depletion of O2 levels caused by the production of ROS. The significance of
PCSK9’s involvement in DENV infection under low-oxygen conditions may not
have been discernible through conventional experimental studies on DENV, which
utilize ambient O2 to incubate viruses and cells. Similarly, the function of PCSK9
remained unknown during mouse studies. Cholesterol is transported in mouse plasma as
HDL rather than LDL. Consequently, cholesterol uptake in rodents is not reliant on
LDLR. Therefore, PCSK9 would not substantially influence on the pathogenesis of DENV
in a murine model [55–58].

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a potentially pandemic zoonotic
pathogen. RVFV penetration is facilitated by the glycoprotein (Gn) of the virus.
LDLR-related protein 1 (mouse Lrp1/human LRP1), heat shock protein (Grp94), and
receptor-associated protein (RAP) were identified by researchers through a
genome-wide CRISPR screen as crucial host factors for RVFV infection. RVFV Gn bonds
specifically to Lrp1 clusters and is independent of glycosylation. Anti-Lrp1
antibodies and murine RAP domain 3 (mRAPD3) exogenously neutralize RVFV infection in
taxonomically diverse cell lines. Mice infected with pathogenic RVFV and treated
with mRAPD3 are protected from mortality and disease [59]. LDLR-associated protein 1 (Lrp1), endoplasmin (Hsp90b1;
herein Grp94), and lipoprotein receptor-associated protein 1 (Lrpap1) were
identified as candidate pro-viral genes. PCSK9 and other known regulators of Lrp1
expression were also determined by the researchers. It is established that an
increase in PCSK9 expression and a decrease in Grp94 expression results in more
rapid degradation of LDLR, including Lrp. Grp94, akin to receptor-associated protein
(RAP), exerts an indirect influence on Lrp1 recycling and cell surface levels.
PCSK9, which is ultimately secreted after being expressed as a pro-protease,
contacts LRP1 to promote LRP1 endocytosis. Grp94 binds to PCSK9 in the ER, impeding
its exit from the cell. Significantly, an inverse correlation is observed between
the relative levels of single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting PCSK9 and RVFV infectivity
when compared to an untreated pooled cell population. Collectively, these
observations offer additional substantiation that RVFV infection requires a pathway
that regulates Lrp1 biosynthesis and surface presentation [59, 60].

At a false discovery rate of 0.01, six SNPs were associated with both
HIV viral load and CD4 T-cell levels. Presumably affecting the binding of
hsa-miR-548t-5p and hsa-miR-4796-3p, Rs17111557 is situated in the 3’
untranslated region of PCSK9. This binding may regulate PCSK9 expression levels. In
an adjusted analysis, Rs17111557 was found to be correlated with LDL cholesterol
levels in women co-infected with HIV and HCV but not in women mono-infected with
HIV. PCSK9 polymorphism may influence the pathogenesis of HIV, especially in women
co-infected with HIV and HCV [61].

Infection with the DENV stimulated the expression of PCSK9, which
inhibits the recycling of LDLR to facilitate the redistribution of cholesterol into
ER-resident STING and IFN-I activation while repressing ER-resident STING.
Inhibitors of PCSK9 substantially enhanced the secretion of IFN-I in response to
this. Additionally, statins are repurposed for the treatment of patients who have
contracted Ebola and influenza. In general, statins exert antiviral properties
through the inhibition or modification of cholesterol trafficking, redistribution,
virus attachment, virion maturation, release, and stability [62]. The Monkeypox virus (MPXV) appears poised
to emerge as an additional global public health emergency, drawing comparisons to
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its predecessors. Repurposing medications that
lower cholesterol levels could be an effective strategy for MPX. Nevertheless,
knowledge regarding the function of cholesterol and its redistribution in MPX
remains limited [63]. Although
cholesterol reduction appears to be an effective antiviral strategy, it may also
weaken the immune system of the host. Additionally, it is important to consider that
since viruses depend on lipid flux, it may be more effective to use statins to
reduce cholesterol levels required for viral maintenance instead of aiming for
global reduction. Patients afflicted with MPX who have hypercholesterolemia should
continue to take cholesterol-lowering medications. PCSK9 inhibitors, statins, and
fenofibrates may be administered in addition to standard medications used to treat
MPX as adjuvant therapy [62]
(Table 2).

this. [53]DENVPCSK9 is an enzyme that inhibits cholesterol uptake

This suggests that the absence of the PCSK9 gene product
leads to increased levels of Lrp1 and, consequently, greater
infection levels. Collectively, these observations offer
additional substantiation that RVFV infection requires a

Effect of PCSK9 in viral infection

As pre-clinical studies show that mAbs, antisense oligonucleotides, and
short interfering RNA can lower LDL-C, blocking PCSK9 is an interesting new way to
treat high cholesterol. It will take more clinical studies and a better
understanding of PCSK9 genetics to determine if these new chemicals will be helpful
in the future [65]. Alirocumab and
evolocumab, subcutaneously injectable mAbs targeting PCSK9, were recently approved
by the FDA and European Medicines Agency. These agents are intended for the
treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients who are unresponsive to statins or
have developed an inadequate response to them. They are particularly beneficial for
secondary prevention or in cases of familial hypercholesterolemia [66]. An alternative strategy involves the
suppression of PCSK9 synthesis. Anti-sense is a novel small interfering RNA-based
therapeutic agent known as inclisiran. It stops the PCSK9 gene from being expressed
by attaching to its messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor. This leads to an increase in
hepatocyte recycling and LDLR expression on the cell surface while LDL-c levels
decrease. This new cholesterol-lowering drug can be added to the treatment of adults
with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia who have an LDL-c level below 100 mg/dL and have not
reached their target LDL-c levels despite taking statins and ezetimibe, or without
statins or ezetimibe if they are allergic to or can’t take one of these drugs
[67].

Progress in recombinant DNA technology has enabled the development of
entirely human mAbs that do not provoke human antimouse antibodies. Consequently,
these antibodies are not eliminated as quickly, leading to increased effectiveness
and reduced occurrences of hypersensitivity reactions. So, improvements in antibody
technology made it seem like a good idea to stop PCSK9 with mAbs that are
100% human [68, 69]. Investigators of the production and action
of a DNA-encoded mAb (DMAb) that targets PCSK9 (daPCSK9) were described as an option
for protein-based drugs to lower lipids. Animals that received a single
intramuscular injection of mouse daPCSK9 continued to express it for more than 42
days. By day seven, this expression was linked to a significant drop of 28.6%
in non-HDL-C and 10.3% in total cholesterol in wild-type (wt) mice. When the
DMAb plasmid was given more than once, expression increased; on day 62, DMAb levels
hit 7.5 µg/mL. DaPCSK9 medicines can lower LDL-C levels. They are
possibly new, cheap, less common, and easy to use. That is, they can be used on
their own or with other LDL-lowering medicines for a more powerful effect
[70].

The current study employed nanotechnological methodologies to create
the initial nano-hepatic targeted anti-PCSK9 small oral molecule. By using
high-throughput optimization techniques and conducting a series of assessments, it
was possible to synthesize and characterize a stable water-dispersible
nano-encapsulated drug (named P-4) conjugated with a hepatic targeting moiety (named
P-21). P-21 presents a practicable and more efficient treatment protocol in contrast
to the FDA-approved mAbs that target uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia to mitigate
the risk of CVDs. The current investigation introduced a nano-targeted drug delivery
strategy for an antagonist of PCSK9/LDLR [71]. Novel PCSK9 inhibitors have been developed via genome
editing technology (CRISPR-Cas9), antisense oligonucleotide silencing agents
(siRNA), vaccines, mimetic peptides, adnectins, and PCSK9 secretion inhibitors as a
result of ongoing research. The inhibitors listed above have undergone extensive
evaluation in animal models in vivo, in vitro, and in phase I and II clinical
trials, where they have proven to have a significant efficacy profile. Subsequent
investigations utilizing these agents will showcase their potential clinical utility
and shed additional light on the diverse intracellular and extracellular targets and
activities of PCSK9, the underlying mechanisms, and the clinical significance of
these actions beyond mere inhibition of LDLR recycling [72]. By employing macrocyclic peptides, it is
possible to target proteins conventionally deemed untreatable via small-molecule
drug design. A novel approach was taken to screen for lead chemicals using mRNA
display technology. These leads were optimized using structure-based drug design
facilitated by novel synthetic chemistry. The result was a macrocyclic peptide
(MK-0616) that exhibited exceptional selectivity and potency towards PCSK9. With a
high affinity (Ki = 5 pM) for PCSK9 as observed in vitro, MK-0616
demonstrated adequate safety and oral bioavailability in preclinical studies,
facilitating its progression to the clinic. In Phase 1 clinical trials involving
healthy adults, the administration of single oral doses of MK-0616 resulted in a
reduction of free, unbound plasma PCSK9 by more than 93% geometric mean
(95% CI: 84–103). Similarly, after 14 days of once-daily dosing of
20 mg MK-0616, multiple oral-dose regimens offered participants on statin
therapy the highest possible reduction of 61% geometric mean (95% CI:
43–85) in LDL-C from baseline [73].

Vaccines against lipoproteins, cholesterol itself, and molecules
involved in cholesterol metabolism have all proved helpful in modifying the course
of sickness in animal models of atherosclerosis. One vaccine that generates
antibodies against cholesteryl ester transfer protein has also advanced into the
domain of human clinical testing [74].
PCSK9 inhibitors in particular have had a significant impact on clinical practice;
angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) inhibition has recently been shown. A few of the
medications currently being used in clinic settings include lomitapide, a
small-molecule inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, inclisiran, a
small interfering RNA that inhibits PCSK9 translation, and the anti-ANGPTL3 mAbs
alirocumab and evolocumab. There are preclinical and clinical trial phases of
research for more medicines. These include vaccinations, gene-editing treatments,
mimetic peptides, adnectins, small-molecule inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides,
and more mAbs. Particularly, gene-editing treatments and vaccines have the potential
to to reduce PCSK9 or ANGPTL3 activity over an extended period significantly or to
knock it down with a single treatment completely. Biologic therapies that are
modeled after situations of monogenic hypocholesterolemia are becoming useful in
preventing atherosclerotic CVDs [75].
The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of estradiol (E2)
treatment vs. recombinant Heat Shock Protein 25 (recombinant HSP25 (rHSP25))
immunization in preventing post-menopausal atherogenesis. Unexpectedly, E2 therapy
reduces atherogenesis and cholesterol levels after ovariectomy (OVX) without
influencing LDLR increasing PCSK9 expression and promoter activity. Increased PCSK9
expression in women responding to E2 therapy has never been documented. rHSP25
vaccination is correlated with reduced cholesterol levels and atherogenesis after
OVX, a process accompanied by an increase in LDLR expression but not PCSK9
expression [76].

Here, researchers assessed the safety and long-term effectiveness of
active vaccinations specific to PCSK9 in several preclinical models. Their patented
approach was practical in selecting PCSK9 peptide-based vaccines. Highly immunogenic
vaccine candidates were injected into wt mice, Ldlr+/− mice, and rats
to evaluate their effectiveness. In all species, vaccination produced PCSK9-specific
antibodies with high affinity. Anti-PCSK9 vaccines based on peptides elicit the
production of antibodies that retain their functionality, affinity, and persistence
for one year. As potent and risk-free instruments for long-term LDL-C management,
they may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the prevention and/or treatment
of CVDs associated with LDL hypercholesterolemia in humans [77]. Researchers have created a novel antiPCSK9
vaccine formulation called Liposomal Immunogenic Fused PCSK9-Tetanus peptide with
Alum adjuvant (L-IFPTA) by combining the AFFITOME® method and nanoliposome
platform technology. The L-IFPTA vaccination can suppress PCSK9-specific T-cell
activation while stimulating a tetanus-specific T-cell response that amplifies
PCSK9-specific B-cell activation, all without causing any safety issues. Antigen
polyvalency is another crucial characteristic that can significantly enhance the
immunogenicity of peptides and elicit effective antibody responses. Polyvalent
antigens facilitate enhanced cross-linking of B-cell receptors, thereby vigorously
stimulating B cell proliferation and potentially reversing the dormant state of
self-reactive B cells. An increase in the expression of molecules that enable
subsequent interactions with Th cells is observed in conjunction with robust B-cell
activation. This leads to producing memory and plasma B cells, which can
consistently generate high-titer antibody responses. However, clinical data about
L-IFPTA remain insufficient until further measures are implemented [78].

In the past investigation, virus-like particles (VLPs)-based vaccines
targeting PCSK9 were developed. Vaccinated with bacteriophage VLPs containing
PCSK9-derived peptides, mice and macaques produced IgG antibodies with a high titer
bound to circulating PCSK9. Significant reductions in total cholesterol, free
cholesterol, phospholipids, and TGs were observed in individuals who received
vaccinations. Therefore, PCSK9-targeting vaccines may be a viable alternative to
mAb-based therapies [79].

The development of a trivalent vaccine candidate specifically targets
explicitly ester transfer protein (CETP), PCSK9, and apoB. Using bacteriophage
Qβ-based VLPs that exhibit antigens of PCKS9, ApoB, and CETP, vaccine
candidates are generated. Vaccine candidate formulations are formulated via hot-melt
extrusion as slow-release PLGA: VLP implants. Comparable levels of antibodies
against the cholesterol checkpoint proteins were generated by the trivalent vaccine
candidate administered via implant compared to a three-dose injection schedule
utilizing soluble mixtures. A decrease in total plasma cholesterol, inhibition of
CETP (in vitro), and a reduction in PCSK9 and apoB levels in plasma are all
accomplished. In its entirety, a platform technology is introduced for single-dose
multi-agent proteins [75]. In this
study, researchers employ a flexible vaccine platform based on capsid virus-like
particles (cVLP) to administer PCSK9-derived peptide antigens and full-length (FL)
PCSK9. Their objective was to determine whether eliciting a more extensive
polyclonal anti-PCSK9 antibody response would facilitate more effective clearance of
plasma PCSK9. The results of this head-to-head immunization study demonstrate that
the FL PCSK9 cVLP vaccine possesses a substantially enhanced ability to opsonize and
eliminate plasma PCSK9. The implications of these findings for developing PCSK9 and
other vaccines that are expected to facilitate opsonization and immune clearance of
target antigens efficiently [80].

Pathogenic point mutations in humans predominantly consist of
C•G to T•A substitutions, which are amenable to direct repair via
adenine base editors (ABEs). Researchers aimed to assess the effectiveness and
safety of ABEs in reducing blood LDL levels in the livers of cynomolgus macaques and
mice. The administration of mRNA containing an ABE and a single-guide RNA that
targets PCSK9, a negative regulator of LDL, via lipid nanoparticles resulted in the
editing of up to 67% (average: 61%) in mice and up to 34%
(average: 26%) in macaques. Plasma concentrations of PCSK9 and LDL were
reduced consistently in rodents by 58% and 55% and in macaques by
32% and 14%, respectively. Rapid clearance of ABE mRNA was observed,
and no off-target mutations were detected in the genomic DNA. Re-dosing did not
enhance editing in macaques, possibly due to the humoral immune response to ABE seen
upon treatment. Further research into the use of ABEs to treat patients with
monogenic liver diseases is warranted in light of these results. It is crucial to
thoroughly evaluate the advantages of clinically viable base editor therapies in
light of the potential risks. Thus, these individuals are prime candidates for
genetic liver diseases, which are presently curable solely through organ
transplantation [81]
(Table 3).

Table 3PCSK9 vaccine and inhibitorsVaccine and inhibitorsExplainRefStatinThis way, PCSK9 polymorphisms were used as stand-ins
for statin treatment. For each unit change in LDL-C, the
mutations in both sites had similar effects on the risk of
ASCVD when added together or on their own. According to the
results of this study, blocking PCSK9 may lower the chance
of heart disease by the same amount per change in LDL-C as
statin treatment. The benefits may be separate or add
up. [82]Anti-senseIt stops the PCSK9 gene from being expressed by
attaching to its messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor. This leads
to an increase in hepatocyte recycling and LDLR expression
on the cell surface while LDL-c levels
decrease. [67]mAbThe fact that mAbs can avoid the liver and
kidneys’ metabolic processes, which lowers drug
interactions, and that they can specifically bind to targets
of interest through the antigen binding site, which makes
these targets ineffective and reduces off-site effects, are
both good things about them. So, improvements in antibody
technology made it seem like a good idea to stop PCSK9 with
mAbs that are 100% human. [68,
69]P-21By employing high-throughput optimization techniques
and conducting a series of assessments, it was possible to
synthesize and characterize a stable water-dispersible

and more efficient treatment protocol in contrast to the
FDA-approved mAbs that target uncontrolled
hypercholesterolemia to mitigate the risk of
CVDs. [71]Alirocumab and EvolocumabCurrently the most efficacious cholesterol-lowering
compounds on the market, these mAbs reduce the risk of
atherosclerotic CVD and diminish LDL-C levels by up to
73%. Novel PCSK9 inhibitors have been developed via
genome editing technology (CRISPR-Cas9), antisense
oligonucleotide silencing agents (siRNA), vaccines, mimetic
peptides, adnectins, and PCSK9 secretion inhibitors as a
result of ongoing research. [72]MK-0616The result was a macrocyclic peptide (MK-0616) that
exhibited exceptional selectivity and potency towards PCSK9.
With a high affinity (Ki = 5 pM) for PCSK9 as
observed in vitro, MK-0616 demonstrated adequate safety and

oral-dose regimens offered participants on statin therapy
the highest possible reduction of 61% geometric mean
(95% CI: 43–85) in LDL-C from

have the potential to reduce PCSK9 or ANGPTL3 activity over
an extended period significantly or to knock it down with a

CVDs [75]rHSP25rHSP25 vaccination is correlated with reduced
cholesterol levels and atherogenesis after OVX, a process
accompanied by an increase in LDLR expression but not PCSK9
expression. [76]Anti-PCSK9 vaccines based on peptidesAnti-PCSK9 vaccines based on peptides elicit the
production of antibodies that retain their functionality,
affinity, and persistence for one year. As potent and
risk-free instruments for long-term LDL-C management, they
may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the
prevention and/or treatment of CVDs associated with LDL
hypercholesterolemia in humans. [77]L-IFPTA + vaccineThe L-IFPTA + vaccine induced a
long-lasting humoral immune response against PCSK9 peptide
in vaccinated hypercholesterolemic mice, according to
long-term studies. This response was accompanied by a
significant reduction in LDL-C by up to 42% over 16
weeks after primary immunization, relative to the control
group. Splenocytes obtained from the vaccinated group
exhibited a more significantly proliferation of
IL-10-producing cells and a reduction in
IFN-γ-producing cells compared to the control and
naive mouse groups. [83]L-IFPTAThe L-IFPTA vaccination can suppress PCSK9-specific
T-cell activation while stimulating a tetanus-specific
T-cell response that amplifies PCSK9-specific B-cell
activation, all without causing any safety issues. This
leads to producing memory and plasma B cells, which can
consistently generate high-titer antibody responses.
However, clinical data about L-IFPTA remain insufficient
until further measures are implemented. [78]VLP-based vaccinesVaccinated with bacteriophage VLPs containing
PCSK9-derived peptides, mice and macaques produced IgG
antibodies with a high titer bound to circulating PCSK9.
Significant reductions in total cholesterol, free
cholesterol, phospholipids, and TGs were observed in
individuals who received vaccinations. Therefore,
PCSK9-targeting vaccines may be a viable alternative to
mAb-based therapies. [79]VLP-based vaccinesA VLP vaccine that specifically targeted a PCSK9
epitope demonstrated efficacy in reducing LDL-C levels in
macaques only when administered in conjunction with statins.
Conversely, immunization with the bivalent vaccine reduced
LDL-C levels independently of the need for statin
co-administration. The effectiveness of an alternative,
vaccine-based strategy for reducing LDL-C is highlighted by
these results. [84]FL PCSK9 cVLP vaccineThe results of this head-to-head immunization study
demonstrate that the FL PCSK9 cVLP vaccine possesses a
substantially enhanced ability to opsonize and eliminate
plasma PCSK9. [80]ABEsResearchers aimed to assess the effectiveness and
safety of ABEs in reducing blood LDL levels in the livers of
cynomolgus macaques and mice. Re-dosing did not enhance
editing in macaques, possibly due to the humoral immune
response to ABE detected upon treatment. [81]

Vaccine and inhibitors | Explain | Ref
--------------------------------------------------
Statin | This way, PCSK9 polymorphisms were used as stand-ins for statin treatment. For each unit change in LDL-C, the mutations in both sites had similar effects on the risk of ASCVD when added together or on their own. According to the results of this study, blocking PCSK9 may lower the chance of heart disease by the same amount per change in LDL-C as statin treatment. The benefits may be separate or add up. | [82]
Anti-sense | It stops the PCSK9 gene from being expressed by attaching to its messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor. This leads to an increase in hepatocyte recycling and LDLR expression on the cell surface while LDL-c levels decrease. | [67]
mAb | The fact that mAbs can avoid the liver and kidneys’ metabolic processes, which lowers drug interactions, and that they can specifically bind to targets of interest through the antigen binding site, which makes these targets ineffective and reduces off-site effects, are both good things about them. So, improvements in antibody technology made it seem like a good idea to stop PCSK9 with mAbs that are 100% human. | [68, 69]
P-21 | By employing high-throughput optimization techniques and conducting a series of assessments, it was possible to synthesize and characterize a stable water-dispersible nano-encapsulated drug (named P-4) conjugated with a hepatic targeting moiety (named P-21). P-21 presents a practicable and more efficient treatment protocol in contrast to the FDA-approved mAbs that target uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia to mitigate the risk of CVDs. | [71]
Alirocumab and Evolocumab | Currently the most efficacious cholesterol-lowering compounds on the market, these mAbs reduce the risk of atherosclerotic CVD and diminish LDL-C levels by up to 73%. Novel PCSK9 inhibitors have been developed via genome editing technology (CRISPR-Cas9), antisense oligonucleotide silencing agents (siRNA), vaccines, mimetic peptides, adnectins, and PCSK9 secretion inhibitors as a result of ongoing research. | [72]
MK-0616 | The result was a macrocyclic peptide (MK-0616) that exhibited exceptional selectivity and potency towards PCSK9. With a high affinity (Ki = 5 pM) for PCSK9 as observed in vitro, MK-0616 demonstrated adequate safety and oral bioavailability in preclinical studies, facilitating its progression to the clinic. Similarly, after 14 days of once-daily dosing of 20 mg MK-0616, multiple oral-dose regimens offered participants on statin therapy the highest possible reduction of 61% geometric mean (95% CI: 43–85) in LDL-C from baseline. | [73]
ANGPTL3 | Particularly, gene-editing treatments and vaccines have the potential to reduce PCSK9 or ANGPTL3 activity over an extended period significantly or to knock it down with a single treatment completely. Biologic treatments that are modeled after situations of monogenic hypocholesterolemia are becoming useful in preventing atherosclerotic CVDs | [75]

PCSK9 vaccine and inhibitors

Determining viral entry receptors is the principal determinant of host
range and tissue tropism. Viruses also utilize cellular lipids and host lipid
metabolism to facilitate reproduction and spread [85]. The host cell and the virus may both have perspectives on
cholesterol during a viral infection. Since virus particles lack interior membrane
structures, their ability to obtain the essential amount of sterol from the infected
cell to sustain the integrity of a solitary macromolecular assembly—their
envelope membrane bilayer—is sufficient. Therefore, broad-spectrum antivirals
may expedite the management of viral infections and improve patient health outcomes.
miRNAs, which influence post-transcriptionally regulated gene expression, have come
to be recognized as crucial regulators of lipid homeostasis. The results of this
study illuminate the intricate characteristics of lipid homeostasis and highlight
the critical role that miRNAs play in controlling this procedure. As a result,
innovative strategies for managing viral infections are suggested. Further
investigation is warranted in future studies to delve into the importance of miRNAs
in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, particularly in the context of cirrhosis and
the chronic inflammation characteristic of viral hepatitis [9, 25]. This, for instance, substantiates the broad-spectrum
antiviral activity of imipramine. Imipramine maintained its antiviral efficacy
against additional arboviruses, such as DENV, WNV, and ZIKV, all members of the
Flavivirus genus. It is expected that these antiviral effects will be mediated
through the inhibition of viral fusion with cell membranes and possibly have a
direct influence on viral replication. The structural characteristics of the viral
fusion proteins of Flavivirus Class II and the envelope glycoprotein of Alphavirus
E1, which aids in viral fusion, are strikingly similar. DENV and WNV are therefore
vulnerable to class II cationic amphiphilic drugs and require cellular cholesterol
to undergo effective fusion reactions. Notably, the requirement for cholesterol in
the life cycle of ZIKV has not been studied. Nonetheless, the researchers’
findings offer an initial indication of how to investigate this route further. By
employing a stable replicon cell line and conducting time-of-addition experiments,
it was determined that imipramine hindered the post-fusion viral RNA replication
stages and prevented the entrance and/or fusion of retroviral pseudoparticles
carrying the chikungunya virus envelope [85–88].

PCSK9 has also been demonstrated to impede the entry and replication of
HCV. PCSK9 had no discernible impact on the assembly or secretion of HCV or its
translation. HCV replication in HCV genomic replicon cells was dose-dependently
inhibited by PCSK9 overexpression, even after infection with cell culture-derived
HCV (HCVcc). PCSK9 inhibition resulted in increased HCV replication. HCV replication
was unaffected by gain-of-function (D3774Y) or loss-of-function (Δaa.
31–52) PCSK9 mutants associated with LDLR degradation. This indicates that
PCSK9’s inhibition of HCV replication was unrelated to LDLR degradation. HCV
replication was downregulated by uncleaved ProPCSK9 but not by cleaved PCSK9; this
suggests that HCV replication was influenced by the auto-cleavage of PCSK9.
Additionally, investigators discovered that PCSK9 interacted with NS5A via NS5A
amino acids 95–215. This region was crucial for HCV replication and NS5A
dimerization, as well as NS5A-RNA binding. Moreover, PCSK9 inhibition of NS5A
dimerization and NS5A-RNA binding occurred upon interaction. Based on these
findings, PCSK9 appeared to impede HCV replication via its interaction with NS5A.
This research should aid in optimizing anti-HCV therapy for patients whose lipid
profiles are uncommon [89].

This research assessed the antiviral efficacy of ezetimibe and
atorvastatin, two cholesterol-lowering drugs, both in combination and as monotherapy
against DENV, ZIKV, and YFV. When it came to fighting DENV 2, atorvastatin and
ezetimibe worked in concert, but when fighting DENV 4, ZIKV, and YFV, they worked
against each other. When atorvastatin or ezetimibe was administered as monotherapy
to AG129 mice infected with DENV 2, their survival rate rose, and their clinical
symptoms decreased. On the other hand, the two drugs’ combination had no
appreciable impact on survival. This study offers important new information on the
potential of ezetimibe and atorvastatin as antiviral medicines against flaviviruses
and emphasizes the need for more research in this area [90]. Furthermore, results demonstrate how DENV
infection induces modifications in the cholesterol metabolism of cells residing in
organs with low oxygen concentrations, thereby promoting the development of the
disease. Significantly, research indicates that using inhibitory mAbs or RNA
interference techniques to impede PCSK9 activity may represent viable and risk-free
therapeutic approaches for DENV patients. In addition, these results suggest that
PCSK9 serves as a host factor for DENV in target cells residing in hypoxic
microenvironments; therefore, targeting PCSK9 for inhibition as opposed to solely
HMGCoA reductase may represent a viable strategy to address the therapeutic gap
associated with DENV [58]. DENV
infection was subsequently diminished in animal models and in vitro through statins
to inhibit the rate-limiting HMG-CoA reductase activity and thereby reduce de novo
cholesterol synthesis. Notwithstanding these encouraging preclinical results, a
clinical trial involving DENV patients and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
lovastatin did not demonstrate any beneficial effects. The adverse clinical trial
result thus calls the laboratory findings’ clinical validity into question
[91–94]. The
concurrent administration of PCSK9 inhibitors and statins holds promise in
mitigating two contributing factors that heighten the likelihood of complications
associated with COVID-19 thrombosis. Therefore, PCSK9 inhibitors may represent an
additional viable therapeutic approach for COVID-19 [95].

An anti-PCSK9 peptide vaccine induced a sustained 50% decrease
in LDL-C levels in murine models of HeFH for one year. An alternative strategy
employed was the administration of a VLP vaccine targeting PCSK9, which resulted in
a reduction of LDL-C in rhesus macaques by 10–15%. VLPs possess
self-antigens on their surface, which enable them to neutralize B-cell antibodies
and circumvent B-cell tolerance. Significant reductions in TG, VLDL-C, HDL-C, and
LDL-C were observed in dyslipidemic obese rodent models (ob/ob mice) and FH mouse
models after vaccination against ANGPTL3. However, these reductions waned after 30
weeks [96]. Inhibition with PCSK9
antibodies (PCSK9i) lowers the risk of cardiovascular events in people with coronary
artery disease, which is linked to high levels. PCSK9 levels are also higher in
people living with HIV (PLWH) and people who have obesity. As a sign of healthy
coronary arteries, high PCSK9 levels in PLWH are linked to poor endothelial
function. To test the idea that PCSK9i can improve poor endothelial function in PLWH
with nearly ideal/above-goal LDL-C levels and dyslipidemia but no coronary artery
disease, researchers looked at this. After taking 480 mg of evolocumab every
4 weeks for 6 weeks, the PLWH group’s cross-sectional area changed by
+ 5.6 ± 5.5% from rest to isometric
handgrip exercise, and the dyslipidemia group’s changed by
+ 4.5 ± 3.1%. Both changes were P < 0.01 compared to the baseline.
Concurrent with the increase in cross-sectional area, there was a notable
enhancement in coronary blood flow in both cohorts. Present the initial evidence
that inhibiting PCSK9 enhances the health of coronary arteries in PLWH and
individuals with dyslipidemia [97]. The
level of interest surrounding therapeutic mAbs has increased significantly annually.
Novel approaches to inhibit PCSK9 are under clinical assessment. The most advanced
development is the small interfering RNA inclisiran, which is currently being tested
in a large cardiovascular outcome trial (NCT03705234). siRNA approaches –
assuming both positive study results and an acceptable safety profile – may
provide a valuable addition to the growing armamentarium for individualized
treatment of dyslipidemias [68]. A new
generation of therapeutic agents for viral infections is now possible due to the
advent of molecular-targeting medicine, which enables the delivery of antigens in a
particular manner, facilitating extremely effective medical treatment. PCSK9 plays a
hitherto unknown role in the pathogenesis of viral infection, and PCSK9 inhibitors
could be a suitable host therapy for patients with viral infection in the future.
Specialized study in this field will help develop treatment and prevention methods
against viral diseases.

Vaccination against influenza and LLT are interventions supported by
scientific evidence that provide significant benefits to patients diagnosed with
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, influenza vaccination
rates and LLT utilization remain inadequate, potentially attributable to widespread
fear-mongering of those targets vaccines and LLT in particular. The relationship
between lack of influenza vaccination and decreased utilization of LLT remains
unexplained. 76% of the 66,923 participants with ASCVD reported using LLT,
and 55% reported receiving influenza vaccination within the past year. The
absence of the influenza vaccine was associated with a decreased likelihood of using
LLTs (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.50, 0.58; p0.001). This association remained
statistically significant in a multivariable regression model for demographics and
co-morbidities (aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.52, 0.64, p < 0.001). This association persisted even
after controlling for health care access, preventive care engagement, and
utilization patterns of other cardiovascular medications (aOR 0.66; 95% CI
0.60, 0.74; p < 0.001).
Subgroups did not differ significantly, including individuals with and without
hyperlipidemia. Among American adults with ASCVD, unvaccinated status for influenza
was independently associated with 34% lower odds of LLT use after controlling
for traditional factors associated with underuse of preventive therapies. This
discovery identifies a demographic group that possesses an elevated risk of
preventable atrial systolic and ventricular disease (ASCVD) that is modifiable. It
further encourages research into unconventional mechanisms contributing to the
underutilization of preventive therapies, such as misinformation [98].

Even though hepatocytes are the principal and most abundant sources of
PCSK9, its production in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages in
particular should not be overlooked. It is important to acknowledge that the
upregulation of PCSK9 production in these cells is predominantly observed in
individuals with atherosclerotic alterations. Furthermore, PCSK9 itself promotes the
activation of these cells and induces additional PCSK9 production. As a result, a
vicious circle ensues. The quantification of PCSK9 concentration will probably
become as intuitive shortly as it is to quantify LDL cholesterol and Lp(a).
Additionally, it is intriguing to ascertain whether PCSK9i and inclisiran exhibit
comparable efficacy in reducing PCSK9 levels. The potential response from the
ORION-3 study may lie in the outcomes, wherein patients were initially administered
either inclisiran or evolocumab. It is expected that the concentration of PCSK9 will
also be ascertained. Thus far, the outcomes of reducing LDL cholesterol are
exclusively available for the group that received inclisiran [99].

Restricted ethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and
N-acetylgalactosamine are novel inhibitors of PCSK9. Furthermore, American
researchers have developed an ASO drug (AZD8233) that exhibits potential for oral
administration as well. Research has demonstrated that PCSK9 levels can be
substantially decreased through subcutaneous injection and oral administration. In
contrast to subcutaneous injection, oral drugs offer patients greater convenience,
circumvent potential risks and discomfort, and enhance patient adherence. However,
the existing clinical data regarding this medication is inadequate, and further
clinical studies are required to validate its subsequent efficacy and safety
[95, 100].

Numerous virus strains, including filoviruses, hepatitis virus,
coronavirus, pseudorabies virus, HIV, influenza virus, and chikungunya virus, have
been linked to cholesterol replication [101–107].
The expression of LDLR was found to be substantially reduced in the context of HBV
infection, while its upregulation facilitated HBV infection. A correlation was
observed between LDLR expression levels and HBV cell attachment, indicating that
LDLR functions as an attachment receptor for HBV cells. A purified LDLR inhibited
apoE pulldown mediated by heparin, indicating that LDLR likely promotes HBV
infection via binding to HBV-associated apoE. Further investigation is necessary to
ascertain whether additional members of the LDLR family are involved in HBV
infection [108]. The coat protein, a
glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), enables the remarkably robust
and pantropic infectivity of VSV. Recombinant variants of VSV and VSV-G-pseudotyped
viral vectors are being extensively utilized for gene transduction in vivo and in
vitro. They are being developed for gene therapy, vaccination, and viral oncolysis
by leveraging this property. In human and mouse cells, LDLR is the primary entry
point for VSV and VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors; other LDLR family members
function as alternative receptors. The extensive prevalence of LDLR family members
explains both the pantropism exhibited by VSV and the wide-ranging utility of
VSV-G-pseudotyped viral vectors in facilitating gene transduction [109]. The ongoing evolution of viral pathogens,
leading to the emergence and resurgence of such pathogens, creates substantial risks
to public health due to the emergence and development of novel phenotypic
characteristics. These characteristics enable the pathogens to exploit changing
environmental and host conditions, making their eradication unattainable for the
foreseeable future. There is currently an absence of efficacious therapeutic
interventions for individuals afflicted with any of the numerous agents comprising
this heterogeneous assemblage of re-emerging and emergent viruses. Due to this, the
development and validation of efficacious antivirals are urgently required. In
consideration of these factors as mentioned above, in addition to the cost-benefit
analysis associated with developing individualized medications for each virus and
the challenge of identifying drug-resistant mutants, contemporary methodologies
primarily concentrate on the advancement of broad-spectrum chemicals that
selectively target pathways that facilitate the development of infections that are
prevalent among different viruses. It has been shown that U18666A, a cationic
amphiphilic compound, inhibits the cholesterol transporter NPC1, thereby preventing
cholesterol from escaping lysosomes. U18666A is a pharmaceutical agent that inhibits
viral infection by influencing the fusion and replication stages of the life cycles
of diverse viruses. Collectively, the results suggest that U18666A exhibits
potential as a therapeutic candidate in the realm of viral treatment through its
ability to impede the progression of viral replication from early and late endosomes
to lysosomes after endocytosis. While the aforementioned in vitro investigations
support the notion that lipid rafts and cholesterol play a crucial role in viral
entrance, conclusive verification in vivo is necessary. Lipid rafts’ apparent
necessity for facilitating the cellular entry of coronaviruses may inspire the
development of novel therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 [31]. Patients who are undergoing cholesterol-lowering treatment
and have a life-threatening COVID-19 infection should discontinue this treatment, at
least until they have fully recovered from the infection, because LDL-cholesterol
can also inactivate the virus [110].
The administration of statins to treat Ebola and influenza has been repurposed.
Infection with Ebola may induce the formation of fusion-inefficient Ebola virus
particles in response to statin use. PCSK9 inhibitors have been employed in treating
DENV infection due to their ability to augment the secretion of IFN-I. Despite the
evident dearth of research examining the repurposing of cholesterol-lowering
medications for the treatment of MPXV, greater emphasis must be placed on
elucidating the mechanisms by which viral infections influence the reassignment of
cellular cholesterol [111]. PCSK9
plays an important role in viruses including influenza, DENV, SARS-CoV-2, HCV, HBV,
Ebola, and MPXV. In addition, findings also indicate that PCSK9 is a host factor for
DENV in target cells resident in hypoxic microenvironments and that inhibiting PCSK9
rather than just HMGCoA reductase could be a useful approach to fill the therapeutic
void for dengue treatment [54].
Although several studies have been conducted on the role of PCSK9 in viral
infections, there is a lack of more specialized studies. Further investigation is
warranted to ascertain the cellular factors that influence the efficacy of PCSK9
inhibitors in mitigating viral infection. To advance the development of novel
therapeutic approaches and enhance our comprehension of the relationship between
viruses and host cells, it is imperative to obtain a more precise understanding of
how PCSK9-induced changes in intracellular cholesterol and LDLR impact viral
infections. Importantly, our study shows that inhibition of PCSK9 activity using
several novel methods of PCSK9 inhibition, such as mAb or siRNA techniques, could be
safe therapeutic strategies to treat viral infection in the future.

PCSK9 controls the concentration of the plasma membrane glycoprotein
LDLR, which is responsible for removing cholesterol-rich LDL particles from the
plasm. In clinical trials, the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab induced
reductions in LDL-C of up to 70% in statin-treated and statin-naïve
patients [112]. For patients diagnosed
with clinical ASCVD, the proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors
(PCSK9i) alirocumab and evolocumab were approved by the Federal Drug Administration
in 2015 [113]. Unlike statins, which
appear to have modest anti-clotting effects, PCSK9 inhibitors do not exhibit such
effects. This anticoagulant effect may increase the likelihood of cerebral
hemorrhaging. It has also been demonstrated that PCSK9 regulates numerous processes,
including hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation, viral
infections, and immune checkpoint regulation in cancer, by targeting other receptors
for degradation. Cholesterol has been implicated in the propagation of numerous
viral infections, including chikungunya virus, filoviruses, hepatitis virus,
coronavirus, and pseudorabies virus, and HIV and influenza virus [31]. Inhibition of PCSK9 has been demonstrated
to impede the progression of certain viral and pathogenic infections, including
DENV, SARS-CoV-2, HCV, and HIV, in recent times [111, 114,
115]. PCSK9 inhibitors, statins,
and fenofibrate may be administered in conjunction with standard medications
utilized in treating MPX as adjuvant therapy [62]. Hence, in light of the recently emerged viral outbreak, it
is imperative not to overlook the potential advantageous implications of repurposing
cholesterol-lowering medications. Furthermore, the comprehensive mapping and
analysis of cholesterol’s varied signaling functions and bioactivities are
essential for advancing therapeutic concepts and our comprehension of viral
infection mechanisms in the future. Conducting further research on the impact of
PCSK9 on cholesterol regulation and metabolism across a diverse array of viruses
could contribute to the mitigation of its drawbacks and the enhancement of its
efficacy.
