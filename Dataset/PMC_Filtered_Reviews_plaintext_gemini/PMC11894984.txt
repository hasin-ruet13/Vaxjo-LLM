Title: Immunologically effective biomaterials-enhanced vaccines against infection of pathogenic microorganisms

Infectious diseases are one of the leading causes of global health threats. One of the most iconic epidemics is the worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of 2022, more than 640 million people have already been infected with COVID-19, and more than 6.6 million have died [1]. In addition, the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the 1980s, as well as viral hepatitis, which has not been eradicated for thousands of years, have caused enormous economic losses and social unrest [2], [3], [4]. While viral infection causes most infectious diseases, some bacterial infection also causes significant risks. Examples include Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) or Mycobacterium avium, which cause the spread of pneumonia or tuberculosis (TB) [5], [6]. In addition, pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the digestive tract is also reported to be one of the top five causes of diarrhea and death in children in developing countries [7]. Therefore, preventing infectious diseases caused by these pathogens is a top priority for the health sectors. However, there are currently limited effective drugs to prevent virus infection. For instance, although several antiviral medications are used to avoid HIV infection, their use is limited due to drug resistance, cost, and other constraints. In addition, antimicrobial drugs also face a great challenge of spawning super-resistant bacteria [8].

Vaccination is of great value in preventing pathogenic infection, as it has significantly reduced the incidence of major epidemics, such as measles, and even resulted in the eradication of smallpox, according to the report of World Health Organization (WHO) [9]. Vaccination activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by presenting antigens and/or providing immune adjuvants to activate humoral and cellular immunity. The humoral immune system includes B cells and antibodies, while the cellular immune system comprises T cells. Upon recognizing the antigens, B cells are activated and secrete neutralizing antibodies, and T cells secret cytokines and directly kill the infected cells to train the body's protective immune responses to recognize and fight against invasion and infection by pathogenic microorganisms [10]. The existing vaccines, such as live attenuated, inactivated, subunit/peptide, and nucleic acid vaccines, work on this principle, but each type meets some problems [11], [12]. Live attenuated or inactivated vaccines have safety concerns, while subunit vaccines improve safety but are less immunogenic. Cutting-edge nucleic acid vaccines allow for rapid response in the face of a pandemic, but bare nucleic acids are poorly stable and highly susceptible to degradation [12]. Therefore, more advanced delivery platforms are urgently required to overcome these bottlenecks to advance the development of antiviral or bacterial vaccines.

Biomaterials-based delivery systems have made tremendous progress in the last decade [13], especially biosafe and healthy biomaterials [14]. The natural or synthetic polymers with biodegradability and great biocompatible can be used as carriers and adjuvants to deliver vaccine antigens and prevent the rapid degradation of antigens [15]. Second, the controllably synthesized polymers can be transformed into different structures, including polymersomes, nanogels, micelles, microneedles (MNs), hydrogels, etc., for various vaccination applications [16], [17]. Surface-modified polymers can also be precisely targeted to the APC surface or within the cytoplasm and prolong the residence time of antigens in APCs, amplifying activation of APCs [18]. Third, polymers act as immune adjuvants due to their inherent immunomodulatory capabilities, enhancing the immunogenicity of vaccines [19], [20]. Moreover, polymers can also be modular, adopting the immunological cues of microorganisms by mimicking the biochemical properties of pathogens or forming hybrid biological-biomaterials to promote a robust and long-lasting protective immune response at the time of vaccination [21]. Thus, immunologically effective biomaterials-enhanced vaccines are an excellent promising strategy against infection by pathogenic microorganisms.

This review summarizes major viral and bacterial pathogens that cause epidemic transmission, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza virus, hepatitis virus, HIV, S. pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), E. coli, and Shigella. We described the characteristics of diseases associated with pathogenic infection and the applications of biomaterials-based vaccines for disease prevention (Scheme 1). In general, we mainly emphasized the efforts made by immunologically effective biomaterials to improve the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of vaccines to inform the development of vaccines.Scheme 1Immunologically effective biomaterials-enhanced vaccines against infection of pathogenic microorganisms.

Infection caused by viruses is a major cause of health risks to human life. Although vaccines have advanced in the prevention of diseases like measles, there are still many diseases that require effective vaccines. Several functional biomaterials have demonstrated excellent vaccine carrier and adjuvant potentials, such as cationic polymers that significantly improve the immunogenicity of antiviral vaccines through electrostatic interactions with viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and efficient plasmid transfection capabilities in APCs [22]. This section focuses on the limitation of existing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, hepatitis virus, and HIV and the advantages of biomaterials-based vaccines (Table 1).Table

SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus composed of four structural proteins, namely spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) [23]. As a member of the human betacoronavirus family, SARS-CoV-2 has caused an unprecedented scale of infection compared to other classes, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mass vaccination has become the primary means of preventing population-to-population transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The WHO has listed more than 100 candidate vaccines against different structures of antigenic proteins and nucleic acids encoding antigens in preclinical development [24], and some vaccines have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as two messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-formulated vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech [25]. However, rapid approval to market has left a legacy of problems for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such as expensive production costs, harsh shipping conditions, and weak immunogenicity [26]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more advanced vaccine platforms. To date, more than 26 candidate nanovaccines have entered clinical trials that demonstrated the outstanding potential of biomaterials-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 [27].

A representative one is the FDA-approved BioNTech/Pfizer BNT162b2 nucleic acid vaccine, a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA vaccine encoding the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [25]. The effectiveness rate of more than 95% has led to the widespread promotion of mRNA vaccine in times of emergency [28]. However, the cold-chain storage conditions of -80 or -20 °C make the application difficult in economically disadvantaged areas [29]. A vaccine based on polymer-delivered mRNA was developed to optimize the lyophilization method of mRNA, relax preservation conditions, and reduce costs [30]. The nanoparticle formed by the complexation of cationic poly(β-amino ester) (PβAE) with mRNA demonstrated the potential to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, cationic nanoparticle delivery of mRNA can modulate the transfection rate of vaccines. One promising strategy is the synthesis of lipid-cationic polymer hybrid nanoparticles for the delivery of mRNA vaccine of SARS-CoV-2 [31]. Using the unique physicochemical properties of two materials, the construction of composite material will improve the transfection efficiency of mRNA vaccines and throttle down the source. For example, Siewert et al. designed a hybrid nanoparticle combining protamine and dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane [32]. Compared to a single complexing agent, the hybrid biopolymer-lipid nanoparticle significantly improved mRNA transfection capacity into immune cells, promoting the immune efficacy of vaccines. This improvement may arise due to the different structural morphologies and surface composition of the combined materials, which lead to a difference in mRNA release when self-assembled with the complexing material. Therefore, composite structure formed by various materials is worth considering to alleviate the high cost and difficult transfer of existing mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to conventional mRNA vaccines, other types of nucleic acid vaccines, such as self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) and DNA vaccines, are also candidates for preventing COVID-19 [33]. These nucleic acid-based vaccines are negatively charged macromolecules that enter immune cells only in a delivery system, such as cationic polymers, dendrimers, nanogels, and polymersomes [34], [35]. The electrostatic interaction between nucleic acids and positively charged biomaterial complexes forms stable vaccines for long-term immune response. For example, Yin et al. developed a separable microneedle (SMN) patch for delivery of low molecular weight poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) nanoparticle that encapsulated DNA encoding S or N protein of the SARS-CoV-2 and resiquimod (R848), an immunostimulant, which activates APCs through toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8)-dependent signal pathway (Fig. 1) [36]. After vaccination, the backing layer of SMN detached through the change in hydrophobicity of SMN under low temperature (14–16 °C) conditions, allowing the SMN to remain in the skin in direct contact with APCs in the dermis. The SMN patch with DNA vaccine could be preserved at room temperature for at least 30 days without a reduced immune response. On the one hand, this continuous delivery allows the recruitment of more APCs. On the other hand, the nanoparticles released from SMN diffuse into the lymph nodes to present antigens. As a result, intradermal injection of nanovaccine-loaded SMN significantly increased CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and the level of virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) [36]. These results illustrate the value of easily synthesized polymers as carriers in improving the performance of approved nucleic acid vaccines, encompassing the efficiency of vaccination, the durability of the immune response, and the versatility of storage conditions.Fig. 1SMN patch for delivery of DNA nanovaccine against COVID-19.

Moreover, another promising vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is subunit vaccine. Although there is no commercially approved subunit vaccine against COVID-19, biomaterials-based vaccines further promote the development of subunit vaccines by improving the immunogenicity of vaccine. First, biomaterials achieve co-delivery of antigens with immune adjuvants, triggering the body to produce more neutralizing antibodies with increased immunogenicity. For instance, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to mediate virus entry into cells [23]. Due to high productivity and stability, RBD is a suitable target antigen for the COVID-19 subunit vaccine. However, RBD has poor immunogenicity and is not ideal as a vaccine antigen alone [37]. Recently, Gale et al. introduced an injectable polymer nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel with an RBD subunit vaccine containing CpG/aluminum (CpG/Alum) adjuvant complex [38]. As a sustained release system, the PNP hydrogel slowly delivered the RBD subunit vaccine and the released adjuvant, allowing more APCs to be recruited into the hydrogel. This platform initiated adaptive immunity and produced large amounts of anti-RBD IgG, significantly enhancing the immunogenicity of RBD subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Second, in addition to the co-delivery of antigen and immune adjuvant, coupling the two components to form an antigen-adjuvant copolymer is another way to enhance vaccine immunogenicity. For example, Gray et al. combined mannose with TLR7 agonist into a copolymer, which was then conjugated with full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to produce Spike-P(Man-TLR7) vaccine [39]. Specifically, the mannose component of copolymer targeted the C-type lectin on the surface of APCs for precise delivery [40]. Then, APCs were effectively activated by the synergistic effect of copolymer TLR7 agonist. Interestingly, the full-length S protein-based subunit vaccine in this system elicited stronger humoral immunity than the RBD vaccine, sufficient to meet FDA approval requirements [39]. The possible reason is that the RBD antigen is smaller than the full-length S protein, and its binding sites to ACE2 are easily and completely obscured by P(Man-TLR7) [41]. The Spike-P(Man-TLR7) stimulated cellular immunity that increased the follicular helper T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells and elicited strong humoral immunity [39]. This demonstrates that biomaterials-based vaccines improve the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, a suitable delivery platform of vaccines needs to be selected according to the physicochemical properties of biomaterial itself and the characteristics of antigenic proteins.

Overall, biomaterials-based vaccines provide new ideas for fighting SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, more advanced synthetic techniques and a variety of material options address the challenges of preserving the cold chain of existing vaccines. At the same time, biomaterials enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines and stimulate a more robust immune response. There are still some obstacles to overcome. The mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines currently promoted in the market suffer from rare but severe allergic reactions attributed to the lipid component of poly(ethylene glycol)2000 (PEG2000) in the composition [42]. Novel materials could be developed to replace PEG to reduce allergy, such as polyphosphoesters [43].

Influenza is a respiratory infectious disease, and the primary causative pathogen of which is the influenza virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family of RNA viruses, divided into types A, B, and C [44]. Influenza viruses contain a negative-stranded RNA genome that is highly susceptible to point mutations in antigenicity-determining regions. These mutations contribute to the diversity of influenza virus strains, like antigenic shift and viral evasion of preexisting immune recognition, resulting in pandemics [45]. While medications are available to treat influenzas, such as oseltamivir and curcumin [46], vaccination remains the central means of preventing the spread of influenza.

Currently, most influenza vaccines are injectable inactivated vaccines. These vaccines induce humoral immunity through intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, producing high titers of IgG antibodies to neutralize the influenza pathogen. IgG in the serum stops the worsening of symptoms after infection with the influenza virus but cannot prevent disease at the site of infection (i.e., the mucous membranes of respiratory tract) [47]. In contrast, intranasal immunity protects the mucosa by inducing secretory IgA. The participation of biomaterial is particularly critical in this route of administration. They can be used as a mucosal adjuvant to prevent virus proliferation and protect the host [48], [49]. Tanishita et al. found that immunized mice intranasally with inactivated H1N1 virus showed significant weight loss after infection with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain [48]. On the contrary, there were few signs associated with a viral infection for mice inoculated with a mixture of viral antigen and tetraglycine-l-octaarginine-linked hyaluronic acid. This is mainly because hyaluronic acid mucosal adjuvant highly induces IgG and IgA, which are capable of cross-reacting with the PR8 virus. Therefore, biomaterial adjuvants are of significant value in changing the route of administration to promote a more robust humoral immune response.

Furthermore, inactivated vaccines that primarily induce humoral immunity have low cross-protective immunity against various subtypes of influenza viruses. Cell-mediated immunity provides broad strain-specific protection and is more cross-reactive than humoral immunity [47]. Coadministration of biomaterials-based immune adjuvants with vaccines induces strong humoral and cellular immunity. Grippol® Quadrivalent (GQ), a commercially available vaccine, consists of Polyoxidonium® adjuvant and recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) from four subtypes of influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, B (Yamagata), and B (Victoria)) [50]. Administered to mice, the GQ vaccine induced HA antibodies and stimulated the activity of dendritic cells (DCs), CD4+ T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Specifically, the antigenic dose of GQ is 1/3 of the standard WHO dose, which implies strong immunogenicity of the polymer adjuvant with the vaccine [50]. In a separate study, squalene-based cationic poly(amino acid) adjuvants co-administered with inactivated H1N1 vaccine also significantly promoted antigen-specific antibody and T cell immune responses and prevented influenza symptoms in mice [51].

Biomaterials-based adjuvants improve the cross-protection of inactivated vaccines against influenza virus infection. However, given the safety concerns for inactivated vaccines and the progress in production processes, subunit influenza vaccines have been developed and implemented [52]. Typically, subunit vaccines are less immunogenic than inactivated vaccines. Biomaterials enhance the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines by providing effective long-term protection and memory immune responses.

One strategy is to inject hydrogels for continuous delivery of influenza HA antigen and immune adjuvant. Saouaf et al. reported that the PNP hydrogel platform containing TLR7/8 agonist and HA antigen significantly prolonged the release time of vaccine with high titers of IgG antibodies in mice up to 56 days after injection [53]. Meanwhile, Roth et al. observed that this PNP hydrogel platform produced cross-protective immunity against different influenza virus mutants [54]. Compared to delivery with Alum adjuvant, the PNP hydrogel platform induced 256-fold, 64-fold, and 16-fold higher IgG antibody titers against influenza variants A/California/07/2009(H1N1), A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1), and PR8 strains, respectively. Therefore, the PNP hydrogel significantly expands the magnitude and effectiveness width of humoral immune response and allows for a reduction in the dose of antigen.

An alternative strategy involves using biomaterials to improve the immunogenicity of influenza subunit vaccines by inducing long-lasting memory cellular immunity. Biomaterials mediate the retention of antigens in APCs and promote APC maturation. They also promote the production of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trms), which rapidly protect the lungs from influenza. For instance, Toy et al. designed the pathogen-like nanoparticle assembled from the H1N1 HA antigen, adjuvant, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and PEI [55]. The adjuvant R848 and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein (RIG-I, PUUC) of nanovaccine targeted the endosomes and cytoplasm of APCs, respectively, and simultaneously activated TLR7/8 and RIG-I pathways, contributing to long-term effective cellular memory immunity. In another study, based on the principle of pH-dependent endosomal escape for precise cytoplasmic delivery of antigen and major histocompatibility type I molecule (MHC-I) processing, Knight et al. designed a pH-responsive nanoparticle vaccine [56]. In the mice model, the nanoparticle vaccine recruited large numbers of antigen-specific Trms in the lung and successfully resisted influenza virus invasion for up to nine weeks.

Biomaterials-based influenza vaccines also enhance innate and adaptive immunity in special populations, such as the elderly, and are a promising influenza vaccine technology for immunocompromised populations. For example, Ross et al. developed a nanovaccine that combined two polymer adjuvants, polyanhydride nanoparticle and pentablock copolymer micelle [57]. The nanovaccine enhanced in vitro activation of isolated DCs in elderly mice and induced specific antibodies, offering hope for influenza vaccines in immunocompromised people.

The most challenging bottleneck facing influenza vaccines is the high mutation rate of influenza viruses that causes antigenic drift. Therefore, promising influenza vaccines must be able to induce cross-protective immunity against different strains. Biomaterials are widely used in influenza vaccines. Acting as immune adjuvants, biomaterials significantly boost humoral immune responses and induce cellular immunity when co-immunized with influenza vaccines. At the same time, biomaterials induced sustained and memory cross-protective immunity to influenza mutant infection by prolonging the release of antigens and expanding APC activation.

Viral infection causes five types of hepatitis, A, B, C, D, and E, notably B and C subtypes, which causes persistent disease in many individuals, even cirrhosis and liver cancer [58]. Although viral suppressor drugs, such as nucleoside analogs, have been developed, current treatments do not completely eradicate the hepatitis virus [59]. The development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines remains the primary strategy to eliminate the viruses. The existing vaccines carried out mainly against hepatitis B virus (HBV), such as the commercially available Engerix-B (yeast recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg)) recombinant vaccine, lack effective cross-reactivity. Moreover, the vaccine does not, or only induce weak antigen-specific T cell responses and is ineffective or less effective in patients with chronic hepatitis [60]. Polymer-based vaccines lift these limitations. Therefore, they are promising anti-hepatitis virus vaccines.

Biomaterials-based DNA vaccine is a powerful tool to prevent chronic hepatitis B. The main barriers to DNA vaccines encoding HBsAg are low transfection rates and transient antigen expression of antigens. Cationic polymers, such as chitosan (CS), poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), PβAE, and linear PEI, have all been reported to improve the delivery and transfection efficiency of DNA vaccines encoding HBsAg in APCs and enhance immunogenicity as immune adjuvants [61], [62], [63]. In a study, Bos et al. compared eight polymers and found that only the cationic polymers PEI, PDMAEMA, and poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (P(DMAEMA-co-MAA)) possessed an excellent ability to transfect myeloid cells and DCs. Moreover, DNA vaccines using these polymers as carriers induced an anti-HBsAg antibody response in vivo, 9-fold higher than naked DNA [62].

Surface-modified cationic polymers often actively target APCs to promote the phagocytosis of DNA vaccines by APCs and activate more robust humoral and cellular immune responses. For example, Soares et al. synthesized PDMAEMA:PβAE multimers as carriers to deliver DNA, and the multimers were modified with dextran that recognizes Dectin-1 on the APC surface. Only a nanoplatform with granular β-glucan glycosylation activated the downstream signaling of APCs [61]. In another study, Layek et al. designed mannosylated phenylalanine grafted chitosan (Man-CS-Phe) to deliver DNA encoding HBsAg. The cationic micelle increased the uptake of APCs, gene expression, and antigen presentation mediated by mannose receptors. Intradermal administration of this vaccine resulted in a solid HBsAg-specific antibody response and cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion in mice, which is essential for enhancing cellular immunity in HBV chronic carriers [63].

Cationic polymers have been widely reported to act as carriers or adjuvants. Additionally, several polymers extracted and purified from natural substances demonstrated adjuvant activity to activate intrinsic and adaptive cellular immunity in HBV DNA vaccination against chronic HBV infection. Du et al. reported the ability of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) as an adjuvant to enhance the immune effect of HBV DNA vaccine [64]. The results show that APS upregulated CD40, CD80, and MHC I/II in DCs. Subsequently, the proliferation of T cells was significantly increased, especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which specifically clear HBV, and the expressed IFN-γ inhibited viral replication [65]. Furthermore, the vaccine also suppressed regulatory T cells and reversed the immunosuppressed state in patients with chronic hepatitis by enhancing immune response [64], [66]. Moreover, the FP-1, a novel heteropolysaccharide extracted from flaxseed hulls, has been reported to inhibit HBV antigen expression (HBsAg and HBeAg) directly and interfere with DNA replication by itself. FP-1, composed of xylose, galactose, rhamnose, galactose, arabinose, fucose, glucose, and mannose, has a triple helix conformation, which allows it to stimulate macrophages to secret nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-12 thus exerting significant immunomodulatory ability and is promising as an anti-HBV drug and an adjuvant for vaccine vector [67].

Biomaterials-based vaccines also promote the development of hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccines. While no licensed HCV vaccine is currently available, biomaterials based on polyphosphazene have demonstrated their ability to protect the E2 glycoprotein antigen of HCV and are adjuvant to immunization [68]. The water-soluble polyphosphazene is highly susceptible to self-assembly into non-covalent complexes with the E2 antigen of HCV, and the biological and chemical structural features of macromolecule allow it to bind multiple copies of the antigen and support it in a multimeric form [68], [69]. For example, Andrianov et al. bonded poly(di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene) (PCPP) to HCV E2 antigen and retained the TLR7/8 agonist R848 on the polymer chain [69]. The antigen and stimulus signals delivered by PCPP were displayed in the multimeric form, which was the main reason for inducing efficient humoral and cellular immune responses. On this basis, poly(di(carboxylatoethylphenoxy)phosphazene) (PCEP), which has subtle structural difference from PCPP, was also derived [70]. Despite the difference of only two methylenes, the latter elicited more potent immune effect than the former. It has been reported that the addition of HCV E2 antigen did not affect the size of PCEP, whereas the PCPP particle size showed a dose-dependent increase with HCV E2 antigen [71]. Therefore, PCEP may have a more vital ability to resist agglomeration and stabilize E2 antigen than PCPP and is a more potent immune activator.

In summary, the current development of vaccines for hepatitis viruses is mainly for HBV and HCV, while the other virus subtypes containing A, D, and E, which lack researches, are targeted to focus on in the future. Since the clearance of hepatitis virus in patients with chronic hepatitis mainly depends on antigen-specific T cells. Therefore, biomaterials-based vaccines especially enhance immunogenicity by boosting cellular immune responses. Moreover, a new role of polymers as vaccine carriers with adjuvant effect and direct inhibition of hepatitis virus DNA replication in infected cells has been reported [67]. Therefore, new properties and deep mechanisms of biomaterials-based vaccines need to be explored in the future.

With nearly 2 million new infection each year, HIV, the pathogen of AIDS, is one of the most severe global health challenges [72]. Several HIV vaccine efficacy trials have been conducted, but only the Thai RV144 vaccine (phase III clinical trial) has shown positive results. However, the efficacy of RV144 dropped from 60% to 30% within 42 to 60 months after administration, suggesting that a higher-quality HIV vaccine is necessary [73]. The advance in the vaccine should focus on immunogens, adjuvants, and delivery routes to stimulate higher levels of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and optimize preventive vaccination against HIV.

The main types of HIV vaccines used in existing researches include subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, and so on. Concerning subunit vaccines, Envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer and protease cleavage sites (PCS) of HIV are target peptides with limited application due to low immunogenicity [74]. To improve the immune effect of Env, Francica et al. designed a polyamidoamine (PAMAM)-based star nanoparticle delivery system that focused on a specific Env variable loop 3/glycan site and successfully triggered high titer of bNAbs HIV [75]. Similarly, Dacoba et al. covalently attached PCS5 to the polysaccharide-based nanoparticle, effectively increasing the anti-PCS antibody (Fig. 2) [76]. PCS5 is bound to CS or hyaluronic acid via oxime or thioether bonds. The former and the latter broke under acidic and high glutathione concentration conditions, respectively, ensuring the extracellular stability of antigenic peptide and its release within the APCs. The level of PCS5 antibody produced in mice increased with time, implying that binding to the polysaccharide significantly promoted the immune potency of antigen. However, the time points at which the highest levels of humoral immunity were elicited differed between polysaccharide polymers, suggesting that vaccine composition and mode of antigen attachment also affect vaccine immunogenicity.Fig. 2Polysaccharide nanoparticle as carrier and adjuvant of vaccine against HIV infection.

Moreover, adding adjuvants significantly aid the induction of bNAbs in subunit vaccines. TLR agonists are widely used as vaccine adjuvants but have poor pharmacokinetics and significant side effects [77]. In a recent study, TLR7/8 agonists were covalently bound to hyperbranched polymers. Th1 cell immune response was significantly enhanced when the polymers interacted with HIV Env gp120, indicating that the complex formed by TLR, glycoprotein gp120, and polymers improve the effectiveness of a single component [78]. Furthermore, the innovations in preparation and administration will also bring advances for subunit vaccines. For instance, Boopathy et al. designed the poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-supporting silk fibroin protein MN encapsulating HIV Env immunogen [79]. Compared to intradermal injection, MN implantation induced a 300-fold increase in serum IgG titers and a 16-fold increase in bone marrow plasma cells, significantly improving vaccine immunization efficiency.

DNA and RNA have also been developed for HIV nucleic acid vaccines. As mentioned above, achievement of stable and sustained delivery is a significant challenge for nucleic acid vaccines. Lu et al. prepared a hybrid two-particle delivery system by introducing polyplex of poly(ethylene glycol)-graft-poly(ethylene imine) (PEG-g-PEI) and HIV DNA into PLGA microsphere [80]. The delivery system significantly improved DNA stability and intracellular release dynamics. Furthermore, long-term sustained immunization is essential in addition to stability, especially for HIV-1 patients. Compared to HIV-2, HIV-1 is a more virulent class of HIV, and patients with HIV-1 will have weaker persistent T cell immunity [81]. Enhancing the T cell response to the most vulnerable functional conserved regions of HIV-1 could be the key to success, and tHIVconsvX immunogens help do this [82]. Moyo et al. synthesized a PEI-saRNA platform to deliver tHIVconsvX [83]. The platform induced a wide range of specific multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells at a high level for at least 22 weeks, indicating the immunological effect of this vaccine.

Briefly, the existing studies mainly focused on subunit vaccines and nucleic acid vaccines. Although there are clinical studies of HIV vaccines, such as PrepVacc, HVTN 706/HPX3002, and HVTN 705/HPX2008, they have not been commercialized [84]. The most important reason for this is the high genetic diversity of HIV driven by Env. In addition, most conventional immunogen delivery systems are incapable of inducing effective and durable immunity to HIV. Biomaterials have emerged as an asset in addressing these dilemmas. In the future, approaches targeting stimulation of the production of bNAb to B cell precursors, novel vaccine delivery systems, and combination vaccines will be the focuses for biomaterials-based HIV vaccines.

In addition to the viruses mentioned above, other viruses also cause severe infectious diseases in recent years, including the human papillomavirus (HPV), Ebola virus, dengue fever, Zika virus, etc. Some reviews have described the applications of biomaterials in these viruses [85], [86], [87]. In this section, we focus on the limitations of existing vaccines against these viruses-associated diseases and the efforts made by biomaterials to overcome the obstacles.

HPV is the most common pathogen of sexual diseases in the United States, causing various anal, penile, cervical cancer, and so forth [88]. Three HPV vaccines have been approved to prevent the most dangerous strains of HPV, with the nine-valent Gardasil-9 containing Alum preventing 90% of HPV-related cancers yearly [89]. However, HPV vaccination rates remain suboptimal due to the need for three injections to maintain adequate immunogenicity and the stress of cold chain transport [90]. To solve the problem, Shao et al. designed an implanted PLGA MN patch to transport HPV-Qβ viral-like particle (VLP) vaccine [91]. The high-temperature melt processing enabled single-dose inoculation of HPV-Qβ particle, sustained immune response, and relief of cold-chain requirement.

Another way to improve vaccination efficiency is to replace the Alum adjuvant in the current HPV vaccine. Recently, polyphosphazene macromolecular adjuvants, such as PCEP and poly(di(carboxylatomethylphenoxy)phosphazene) (PCMP), have been found to form supramolecular self-assemblies with the HPV16L1-16L2 virus-like particle (RG1-VLP) vaccine for HPV, which showed strong humoral immunity against HPV infection [92], [93]. Valencia et al. reported that RG1-VLP vaccine doses adjuvanted by PCEP could be reduced by 75%, and the level of produced antibody was higher than that of a vaccine with the VLP/Alum adjuvant alhydrogel [92]. Therefore, biomaterials-based adjuvants are the preferred choice of HPV vaccine adjuvants.

Ebola fever, caused by the Ebola virus, is one of the most dangerous infectious diseases known to man [94]. Recent studies have shown that vaccines against Ebola require effective stimulation of T cell immune responses, specifically CD8+ T cells [95]. Karpenko et al. constructed a plasmid encoding T cell immunogens to generate artificial T cell immunogens in transfected cells for specific responses to CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes [96]. Assisted by PAMAM dendrimer, the DNA vaccines induced significant T cell response in mice. However, the DNA delivery efficiency of vaccine is related to the size and surface charge of dendrimer, and the exact mechanism is unknown and needs further exploration. Further, vaccine candidates that induce T cell immune responses for a relatively short time after vaccination are still under development, which could be a possible direction for future researches on biomaterials-based anti-Ebola vaccines.

Dengue fever is an infectious disease caused by the dengue virus transmitted by insect-borne bites [97]. It is caused by any of the four serotypes of dengue virus, and systems in infected individuals range from fever to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome that threaten human health [98]. Currently, the vaccine Dengvaxia is approved in Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines for use in people aged 9–45 years [98]. However, in a cohort study of children vaccinated in the Philippines, the vaccine was found to protect against severe dengue fever in seropositive individuals but increased the risk of untreated severe dengue infection and hospitalization [99]. Therefore, the development of a safer and more effective vaccine is imminent.

By mimicking the natural transmission mode of dengue virus, vaccines by the transdermal route have attracted significant interest. There is data supporting the ability of percutaneous inoculation to activate Langerhans cells and dermal DCs that produce more robust immune responses than deeper subcutaneous vaccination [100]. In a recent study, a subunit vaccine composed of a dengue virus antigen and two adjuvants was made into a multi-layer MN consisting of PβAE, PAA, and poly(O-nitrobenzylmethacrylate-co-(hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-co-(poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate)) for percutaneous injection [101]. In an in vitro human skin model and in vivo mice model, the MN vaccine had been demonstrated to achieve sustained and co-release of adjuvant and antigen to APCs for up to two weeks. The long-lasting immune activation effect in the context of biomaterial involvement will drive the development of vaccines against dengue. Such vaccines designed to exploit the infection pathway and characteristics of the virus will be more expected.

Zika virus is an arbovirus belonging to the Flavivirus genus of Flaviviridae family [102]. Because of the association with neurological disorders and fetal abnormalities, vaccine development is critical for pregnant women and travelers in endemic areas. Immune adjuvants are usually required to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines, and traditional Alum adjuvants that induce Th1/2 responses in humans have been successfully used to prepare viral vaccines in humans. However, they may increase the risk of neurotoxicity and immune diseases, leading to side effects [103]. In this context, Wu et al. encapsulated inactivated Zika virus in a nanocomplex consisting of CS and γ-poly(glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) by the electrokinetic method [104]. The nanocomplex, acting as an immune adjuvant, successfully induced anti-Zika virus IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies with balanced Th1/2 responses in mice. This result demonstrates that biomaterials with simple composition and inherent immune adjuvant properties extend the currently limited number of vaccine adjuvants to improve immunogenicity.

The above types of infectious diseases are still prevalent in some places, causing damage to people and property. However, the development of vaccines for these types of viruses, including HPV, Ebola virus, dengue fever, and Zika virus, is still limited and needs to be explored in depth. Above all, new adjuvants other than conventional Alum adjuvants that can be delivered together with the vaccine must be found. Furthermore, the vaccine design concept needs to incorporate the characteristics of virus itself, including the chemical structure, the route of transmission, and the mode of immune response of the organism.

Different bacteria cause diseases with similar clinical manifestations, but there is a great deal of specificity between genera. Different subtypes of antigens are also present in the same genus, leading to complexity and difficulty in vaccine design. Immunogenic biomaterials-adjuvanted vaccines deliver multiple subantigenic units simultaneously, improving the immunogenicity of antimicrobial vaccines. This chapter will focus on the value of polymers-based vaccines in preventing respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases caused by bacteria (Table 2).Table 2Immunologically effective biomaterials-enhanced vaccines against bacterial infection.Pathogenic virusVaccine typeAntigenPolymerDelivery systemAdjuvantRouteResultRef.S. pneumoniaeSubunit vaccinePsaACSCS-PsaA nanocapsule—i.n.The nanocapsule effectively delivered antigen with ideal mucosal adhesion, stability, and immune effect.[108]Subunit vaccinePspAcCHPcCHP-PspA nanogel—i.n.The vaccine significantly induced IgG and C3 deposition in macaques.[110]Subunit vaccinePspAcCHPcCHP-PspA nanogel—i.n.The immune responses induced by nanogel in non-human primates were mediated by Th2 and Th17, and the nanogel was not deposited in the brain.[111]Subunit vaccinePspAPβAEPβAE and E. coli hybridE. coli with natural adjuvant propertiesi.p./s.c./i.n.Hybrid biomaterial vector provided opportunity for “in situ” antigen production in APCs.[21]MtbSubunit vaccineHspX (Rv2031c), EsxV (Rv19c), and PPE44 (Rv2770c)CS or TMCCS- or TMC-coated PLGA nanoparticleCS- or TMCi.n. or s.c.Subcutaneous administration elicited higher cellular immunity compared to nasal administration and TMC-coated PLGA nanoparticle enhanced Th1 and mucosal immunity more effectively than CS.[115]Subunit vaccine10 kDa culture filtrate protein and ESAT-6CS or polyarginineCS:Ag, INU:PArg:Ag, or INU:Ag:PArg nanocapsuleTLR7/8 agonist imiquimodi.n.Only vaccine containing INU: PArg: Ag induced sufficient IgA.[117]Subunit vaccineH4 and H8 fusion antigenPolyesterPolyester-particle self-assembly in the presence of (R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA—s.c.The polyester-particle vaccine induced relatively strong production of IFN-γ and IL-17A cytokines.[119]Subunit vaccineH4 and H8 fusion antigenPolyesterPolyesternanoparticle-H28 and H28 nanoparticle—s.c.Polyester nanoparticle of Bifidobacterium bovis antigen-fused H4 induced protective immunity in the lung at a level similar to that of BCG.[120]Subunit vaccineESAT-6 and antigen 85APHAPHA bio-bead produced by Mycobacterium discoideum—s.c.The vaccine enabled the immobilization of specific antigens onto the surface of PHA bio-bead to prevent Mtb.[121]E. coliSubunit vaccinerEIT (EspA, Intimin, and Tir)CSCS nanoparticle—OralAdhesion of E. coli O157: H7 to intestinal epithelial cells decreased by loading CS with rEIT antigen.[125]Subunit vaccineF4 antigenCSEudragit L100 modified porous CS nanoparticle—OralEudragit L100 modified oral porous nanoparticle reduced the excretion of ETEC.[126]Subunit vaccineCfaB, CstH, CotA, and LTBPLGAPLGA nanoparticle—OralThe vaccine inhibited the binding of enterotoxin to GM1-gangliosides and neutralized the effects of LTB toxin on effusions in the loop of ileum.[127]Subunit vaccineLTB, STXB, and CTXBCSCS nanoparticle—OralThe nanovaccine with all three antigens prevented from ETEC and EHEC attacking.[129]ShigellaSubunit vaccineMxiH antigenCSCS nanoparticle—i.n.CS vaccine coated with MxiH antigen stimulated B cells and increased IgG and IgA in nasal epithelium mucosa.[131]Subunit vaccineOMV antigen complexGantrez® AN119Thermo-sensitive hydrogel consisting of polymer Gantrez® AN119 and surfactant Pluronic F127—i.n.Delivery of thermo-sensitive hydrogel prolonged the residence time of OMV antigen in nasal cavity.[134]Subunit vaccineN-terminal region of IpaD antigenCSO-metylated free TMC nanoparticle—OralThe TMC-coated antigens significantly enhanced antigen-specific IgG and IgA in Shigella flexneri-infected guinea pigs compared to naked antigens.[135]Subunit vaccineO-polysaccharidePolysaccharideSelf-assembledproteinaceousnanoparticle—s.c.The Nano-B5 platform can be combined with different modular components and antigens to protect the continued survival of all animals.[18]Subunit vaccineO-polysaccharidePolysaccharidePolysaccharide-nanoconjugate VLP—s.c.The O-polysaccharide obtained from Shigella flexneri 2a can be bound to the surface of VLP to prevent Shigella infection.[137]Abbreviations: Ag, antigen;

Respiratory diseases caused by bacteriologic pathogens also produce serious health problems, and the main victim groups include children and the elderly and immunodeficient populations. Relevant studies of vaccines against such pathogens have been developed for several years, such as the 23-valent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine against pneumococcal infection and Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine against TB infection [105], [106]. However, these vaccines are administered by a single intramuscular injection and provide protective immunity against only several serotypes. Since these bacteria are present in the mucous membrane of respiratory tract through fixed values, vaccines need to be developed to elicit a broad immune response and produce mucosal and systemic protection. Biomaterials-based vaccines have been used to deliver multiple subtypes of antigens and optimize the administration mode to compensate for the above limitations. This section will focus on polymer-related vaccines to prevent S. pneumoniae and Mtb.

S. pneumoniae, a gram-positive bacterium, often colonizes the upper respiratory tract of humans, causing pneumonia and sepsis. There are a variety of proteins and capsular polysaccharides on the cell surface of S. pneumoniae, some of which are expressed on all serotypes and are, therefore, candidate antigens for subunit vaccines, such as pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and pneumococcal surface acrylate A (PsaA) [107]. Many vaccine delivery systems loading these widely expressed protein antigens have been developed to achieve universal prevention of pneumococcal disease [108], [109], [110], [111]. For example, Robla et al. designed the thiol-maleimide-conjugated CS nanocapsule loaded with PsaA [108]. The covalent polymer-protein binding in the nanocapsule resulted in a 3-fold increase in PsaA binding. Meanwhile, the epithelial adhesion property of CS enabled the nanocapsule to present PsaA adequately to APCs in the nasal mucosa to activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, indicating that nanocapsule effectively delivered PsaA with outstanding mucosal adhesion, stability, and immune effect. It is worth noting that using maleimide as a cross-linking agent for thiols requires careful consideration. Due to the immunogenicity of maleimide, it may inhibit the immune response to the linker ligand [112].

However, the most critical vaccine regimen to prevent S. pneumoniae transmission is to produce specific IgG and IgA antibodies to block the infection and epithelial fixation of the pathogen, respectively. In this regard, PspA seems to have a significant advantage over PsaA [113]. Cross-reactive neutralizing immune effects have been reported to be induced by nanogel made of cationic cholesterol branched-chain starch piggybacked on PspA as an adjuvant-free vaccine [109]. Hiroshi Kiyono and co-workers tried to validate the effect, mechanism, and safety of cationic cholesteryl pullulan (cCHP) nanogel vaccine [109], [110], [111]. The adjuvant-free vaccine induced the same IgG levels as Alum adjuvant in mice intranasally and induced PspA-specific IgA [110]. The immune effect mainly depended on the immune response mediated by Th2 and Th17. Furthermore, as proved by nuclear magnetic resonance, the vaccines were not deposited in the olfactory bulb and brain of macaques, indicating their safety [111]. Thus, the development of adjuvant-free cCHP nanogel vaccine is a safe and effective strategy expected to prevent human pneumonia transmission.

While direct delivery of PspA promotes the immunogenicity of original subunit vaccine, it would be more attractive to design vectors that deliver a broad range of antigenic forms and enhance the immune response in multiple dimensions. A unique strategy is to deliver PspA by hybrid biological-biomaterial vectors. For example, Li et al. designed a hybrid vaccine utilizing a non-pathogenic E. coli with natural adjuvant effects as the biological core of vector and a mannosylated PβAE coating as the biomaterial component [21]. Active targeting and uptake of APCs have provided the potential for intracellular antigenic integration and release of E. coli in the APCs. Interestingly, each component of the hybrid vector promotes the immune response, and the vector adjuvant induced higher IgG and IgA levels than the Alum adjuvant at a 20-fold lower PspA dose. Even the vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies against 11 strains of S. pneumoniae, inducing a broad spectrum of anti-pneumococcal immunity. Using E. coli as a core, a common tool in molecular biology, hybrid biological biomaterials offer new ideas for smart vaccines produced with built-in antigens. Strategies and combinations of biomaterials and biological components that complement each other and increase the immunogenic effects will deserve more in-depth explorations in the future.

TB, mainly caused by Mtb and Mycobacterium bovis, is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide [6]. There are currently two main types of vaccine candidates to prevent TB. One is the mycobacterial whole-cell-derived vaccine, represented by BCG, the only vaccine approved to date to prevent TB in infants [114]. Another is a subunit vaccine that selects a limited number of antigens, such as the fusion antigen of H4 and H28 [114]. Subunit vaccines are easier to be promoted because of their diverse antigen composition, effectiveness in combination with adjuvants, and high safety. Like subunit vaccines against other pathogens, subunit vaccines that prevent TB require integration with advanced delivery platforms to improve their poor immunogenicity.

The conventional strategy is for the biomaterials to act as adjuvants or carry an adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines. Degradable and biosafe polymers, such as PLGA and CS, are highly recommended among such carriers. Zare et al. designed a PLGA nanosphere carrier modified with cationic CS or N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) to transport triple-fused antigens for TB vaccines, eliciting excellent cytoprotective and mucosal immunity [115]. In addition to its inherent immune-activating properties, CS has excellent mucosal adsorption capacity to facilitate the action of delivered antigens across the mucosal barrier [116]. In contrast, tuberculosis is transmitted by inhaling Mtb-containing aerosols, making CS an excellent intranasal vaccine carrier and immune adjuvant. Nevertheless, in another study, Diego-González et al. compared CS and inulin/polyarginine as nanocapsule shell to deliver the TLR7/8 agonist imiquimod and the ESAT-6-CFP-10 fusion antigen that elicited mucosal immunity [117]. Despite the better immune activation property of CS-based vaccine in vitro, in vivo experiments confirmed that specific sIgA antibody was induced only when the antigen was modified on the surface of inulin/polyarginine polymer. This phenomenon may be because upon binding to the antigen, the latter has a stronger positive charge and is more favorable to interact with negatively charged epithelial mucins [118]. This also indicates that the composition of polymer and the location of antigen significantly affect the immune effect of vaccine.

Another strategy is the surface immobilization and presentation of mycobacterial antigen fusions by particle delivery systems made of biomaterials and biological components. One of the particle systems of interest is the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) bio-bead class. This naturally occurring biopolyester self-assembles to form the hydrophobic core of particles. The researchers combined this property with bioengineering of the delivery of proteins needed on the surface of polyester particles as a multi-antigen delivery library for extended Mtb
[119], [120], [121]. For example, Chen et al. transformed plasmids encoding PHA synthase (a key enzyme for polyester particle biosynthesis) and TB antigen (H4/H28) into bioengineering of ClearColi BL21 (DE3) for polyester particle production [119]. In contrast to the soluble H4/H28 vaccine, the surface antigen of polyester particle vaccine triggered specific CD4+ T cell effect, demonstrating IFN-γ-stimulated secretion levels of up to 20,000 pg mL–1, an essential indicator of the efficacy of anti-Mtb vaccine [114], [119]. Furthermore, the H4/H28 surface antigen vaccine delivered by polyester particle also induced a long-lasting memory T cell immune response, with Th1 cytokine secretion still detectable up to 12 weeks after the last vaccination [120]. A further strategy is to replace DE3 with Mycobacterium to produce PHA bio-beads to obtain diverse subunit vaccine antigens that achieve immunogenicity comparable to that of attenuated or inactivated vaccines [121]. Nevertheless, the efficacy of such vaccines against TB is currently unproven and needs further exploration.

In conclusion, the bacteria invade the organism and first fixate on the respiratory mucosa, so the design of vaccine firstly requires the induction of secretory IgA and serum IgG antibodies. Second, this mode of pathogen invasion makes nasal administration unique. The vaccine vectors need immunogenicity and mucosal adhesion properties in this route. They are expected to break the mucosal barrier, protect the antigens from nasal enzymatic degradation, and enhance vaccine delivery to the nasal lymphoid tissue to promote an immunological effect of vaccines.

Intestinal diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children in developing countries. In addition to viral pathogens, bacterial pathogens are the leading cause of intestinal infection. The bacteria present in the gastrointestinal tract of humans mainly belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family, most of which are the normal intestinal tract flora. When the state of host organism changes, bacteria with pathogenic effects on humans, such as pathogenic E. coli and Shigella, cause intestinal infection in the body, manifested as changes in the performance of feces, diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, etc., and in severe cases, even life-threatening [122]. Unfortunately, no effective vaccine protects humans from gastrointestinal infection [123]. The main obstacles are considerable genus specificity of the pathogenic bacteria, the weak immunogenicity of antigens, and the limitations of gastrointestinal mode of administration. Therefore, polymer vaccines can be designed to address these weaknesses, thus reducing the fixation and virulence of pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract.

There are five subtypes of pathogenic E. coli of which the most susceptible to the disease are enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). These bacteria first colonize the intestinal epithelial cells through bacterial hairs and release large amounts of toxins that impair cell function. The former mainly causes diarrhea in humans, while the latter has caused global outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome [124]. Therefore, blocking the colonization of intestinal tract by bacterial hairs has become a primary goal in producing pathogenic E. coli vaccines.

Earlier, Khanifar et al. used CS to piggyback on the colonization factor of EHEC (E. coli-secreted proteins A, Intimin, and translocated intimin receptor), which blocked the bridge of bacterial hairs to adhere to the intestine [125]. Compared to direct oral administration, CS encapsulation prevented the rapid degradation of antigens in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the low resistance of CS to acidic pH may limit its use as an oral vaccine carrier. Eudragit L100-coated CS further protects against antigen degradation under acidic conditions and reduce the adhesion of E. coli
[126]. Nevertheless, the strategy of encapsulating the colonization factor alone only elicits limited humoral and cellular immunity.

Therefore, a better option is to use biomaterials to simultaneously transport virulence factors involved in pathogenesis, including colonization factors and toxin antigens, to form recombinant conjugate vaccines and enhance the immunogenicity. For example, Nazarian et al. used another synthetic polymer, PLGA, with good biocompatibility to encapsulate ETEC with different serotypes of the colonization factors (CfaB, CstH, and CotA) as well as the labile toxin antigen to form an oral vaccine with PLGA-chimeric protein [127]. The encapsulation of PLGA likewise protected the antigen from degradation in low pH conditions in the stomach. At the same time, the particle size of PLGA polymer after antigen encapsulation was around 250 nm, and nanoparticles of this size can be phagocytosed by APCs and increase antigen uptake by lymphoid tissues [128]. The results show that the vaccine prevented ETEC colonization while also neutralizing the toxic effects of toxins on intestinal epithelial cells. Importantly, oral administration of the chimeric vaccine to mice resulted in serum IgG and fecal IgA antibodies, i.e., induced systemic and mucosal immune responses [127]. In addition, chimeric ETEC- and EHEC-specific virulence proteins allow the design of vaccines against both bacteria, enhancing the immunogenicity of antigens and thus achieving the goal of preventing intestinal diseases caused by pathogenic E. coli
[129].

Another common bacterium causing gastrointestinal infection is Shigella, including Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, and Shigella sonnei
[130]. Shigella primarily causes acute intestinal infection and symptoms range from mild watery diarrhea to severe bacterial dysentery. Since this bacterium is highly resistant to antibiotics and no effective vaccine is available, developing advanced vaccines is urgent.

CS is one of the favorable contenders. Gilavand et al. piggybacked the MxiH antigen, a virulence protein in most gram-negative bacteria, with CS to form a mucosal vaccine [131]. CS increased the permeability of tight junctions between cells [132], thus facilitating the passage of CS vaccine through the nasal mucosal barrier, activating nasal epithelial mucosal plasma cells and B cells, which produced mucosa-specific sIgA antibodies [131]. However, lysozyme in the nasal mucosa degrades CS, causing a rapid release of antigens [133]. Thermo-sensitive hydrogels have become carriers to prolong the persistence of antigens in the locus. A thermo-sensitive hydrogel consisting of Gantrez®AN119 (Gz) and the surfactant PluronicF127 prolonged the adhesion of antigen at the mucosal site, while Gz was an activator of TLR2 and TLR4 that synergistically activated APCs and enhanced immunogenicity [134].

Since Shigella is a gram-negative bacillus, the proteins and lipopolysaccharides present in Shigella are potential immunogens for antibacterial purposes [123]. Some nanovaccines carrying protein antigens have been developed [131], [135], but it is challenging to bind structurally complex polysaccharide antigens to nanovaccines. Pan et al. designed a highly versatile and modular nanovaccine platform (Nano-B5 platform) [18]. The peptide containing the AB5 toxin B subunit protein was attached to the nanoplatform by a protein fusion domain, and the bacterial O-polysaccharide obtained from Shigela flexneri 2a was glycosylated and attached to the nanoplatform (Fig. 3). The nanovaccine bound to the monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) receptor on the surface of APCs and promoted antigen presentation [136]. It activated both humoral and cellular immunity, producing neutralizing antibodies or directly destroying the pathogen, effectively preventing Shigella infection in mice [18]. Furthermore, nanovaccines synthesized based on orthogonal and modular biosynthesis methods and combined with protein glycosylation technology selectively piggyback protein-glycan antigens in a controlled manner with good lymph node targeting and immune system activation [137].Fig. 3Self-assembling and modular Nano-B5 platform against Shigella infection.

Among the pathogens causing gastrointestinal diseases, Escherichia coli and Shigella are the most primary contributors to fatal diarrheal diseases in children [138]. The development of vaccines against them is crucial. Since the main infected population is infants and young children, children with very low maternal antibodies have a poor immune response to vaccines. Therefore, the design of vaccines is guided first by the principle of safety and then by the need to improve the immunogenicity of vaccines. Meanwhile, constructing the best experimental model is also an issue to consider.

Biomaterials have been widely used to develop effective vaccines to prevent pathogenic microorganisms. In this review, we sort out the applications of immunologically effective biomaterials, especially polymers, to prevent viral and bacterial infection, providing a solid foundation for developing future epidemic vaccines. Immunogenically effective biomaterials have several advantages. First, polymers effectively load various components of the vaccines, such as antigens, small molecule adjuvants, and so forth. Second, modified polymers, such as Man-CS-Phe, actively target APCs to deliver antigens precisely [63]. Third, polymers with biological properties, such as hybrid biological biomaterials generated using E. coli plasmids, achieve the whole process of APC antigen internalization, release, processing, and cross-presentation [21]. Fourth, polymers with inherent immunomodulatory properties, such as cationic CS, also replace conventional adjuvants, such as Alum, to elicit more effective immune effects [104]. Thus, advanced delivery systems based on biomaterials, especially polymers, provide immunogenicity of vaccines from all aspects. In addition, polymers that can be easily synthesized and modified, and can also be used in large-scale production. The hybrid nanoparticle made of protamine and lipid is a candidate that improve the mRNA transfection rate of existing COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. On the one hand, to improve the efficiency of vaccines, and on the other hand, to reduce the challenges caused by cold chain transport due to their accessible preservation properties [32].

Despite the above advantages of polymer-based vaccines, some issues still need to be addressed to promote these conventional vaccines better. The first step is a thorough safety assessment of the polymers, especially since there may be unexpected cytotoxic or immune responses to their biodegradation products. In addition, there is a need to develop rigorous and uniform criteria for vaccine efficacy evaluation, which needs to be combined with the specific immune responses of various organisms against the pathogens of different infectious diseases. Overall, immunologically effective biomaterials remain promising platforms for vaccine delivery and deserve to be explored more deeply.
