Title: Synthetic Glycans to Improve Current Glycoconjugate
Vaccines and Fight Antimicrobial Resistance

Vaccination is one of the most impactful medical strategies protecting
human health, and it has been shown to be the most effective intervention
to control infectious diseases.1 Carbohydrates,
surrounding the surface of bacteria and fungi, play important roles
in the establishment of infection, acting as virulence factors but
also hiding the microorganisms from the immune system of the host
and activating inflammatory responses. For these reasons, cell surface
polysaccharides have been targeted for the development of bacterial
vaccines. A first generation of polysaccharide-based vaccines against meningococcus, pneumococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was licensed between
the ’70s and the early ’80s and demonstrated to be efficacious
in adults. However, these vaccines failed to provide adequate protection
in infants and children under two years of age, which are the populations
at higher risk of infections.2,3 The introduction of
glycoconjugate vaccines, composed of a carbohydrate covalently linked
to a carrier protein, has overcome this limitation, by raising a carbohydrate
directed T-cell-dependent immune response,4 ensuring efficaciousness in children and the elderly. Today commercial
glycoconjugate vaccines are available to prevent bacteremia, pneumonia,
and meningitidis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria
meningitidis in infants. Recently, the FDA approved the PCV15
and PCV20 pneumococcal vaccines from Merck and Pfizer,5,6 containing 15 or 20 different serotypes, that have shown an impact
in reducing noninvasive illnesses such as acute otitis media, nonbacteremic
pneumonia, and sinusitis.7 A conjugate
vaccine against typhoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi,8 showing high protectivity and
a sustained immune response in children as young as six months of
age, has also been licensed. The glycoconjugate vaccines licensed
to date by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Agency (EMA) are shown in Table 1. All marketed vaccines are based on the chemical conjugation
of capsular polysaccharides, and because of their capacity to control
a variety of bacterial infections, more vaccines targeting unmet medical
needs are either under development at a preclinical level or in clinical
trials (Table 2).8 Over the last two years the world has seen the
SARS-Cov2 pandemic become a major scourge, and the preparedness for
future pandemics has become a priority for governments. The emergence
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can be considered a silent pandemic
that could lead to consequences far more deadly than COVID-19.9 The threat of AMR undermines progress in health
care, food production, and life expectancy and can have a major impact
on society. Reports from the Center for Disease Control (CDC)10 and the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance
Network (EARS-Net)11 have identified different
microorganisms, including the bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii,
Clostridioides difficile, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-typhoidal Salmonella, and Staphylococcus
aureus and the fungus Candida auris, as
serious AMR threats.12 Others, such as
group A and B Streptococci, are classified as concerning
threats. As the diseases associated with these pathogens are currently
not prevented by vaccination, the identification of novel candidates
is becoming an urgent need.13 Vaccination
appears to be less vulnerable to genetic evolution and, consequently,
to resistance, as compared to antibiotic treatment, and it can also
provide protection for individuals who are not vaccinated through
herd immunity.14,15 Different from the currently
commercialized glycoconjugate vaccines, which are generally administered
to healthy individuals to prevent the disease, vaccines against AMR
pathogens should provide a fast and robust immune response also in
a nosocomial setting or in subjects with underlying conditions, for
example to combat the carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, that often occurs in hospitalized older adult patients.16

A. *Glycoconjugate vaccines in multivalent combination with other
vaccines.

Historically,
vaccines were constructed using polysaccharides isolated
from pathogens and were developed primarily based on empirical evidence.
Recent times have seen enormous progress in methodologies for the
assembly of complex glycans and glycoconjugates, with developments
in synthetic, chemoenzymatic, and glycoengineering methodologies.17 Synthetic carbohydrate chemistry offers a unique
tool to obtain well-defined, thoroughly characterized carbohydrate
antigens of high purity and devoid of any potential microbial contaminant.
Fully synthetic antigens reached the clinic by the synthetic Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in Cuba,18 and more recently a vaccine to fight shigellosis
has progressed to phase II clinical trials.19,20 The use of synthetic glycans with modern structural glycobiology
approaches, such as glycan arrays, X-ray crystallography, surface
plasmon resonance, and saturation transfer difference NMR, can nowadays
be used for rational rather than trial-and-error-based glycoconjugate
vaccine design.21,22 This review aims at discussing
the advancement of glycoconjugate vaccines based on synthetic carbohydrates
to improve existing vaccines and identify novel candidates to combat
AMR. Through this literature survey we intend to build structure–immunogenicity
relationships from available data and identify gaps to be covered
to advance synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccines to fight AMR.

The bacterial cell wall is surrounded by a dense
layer of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, named the glycocalyx,
which allows bacteria to survive in the surrounding environment, while
permitting the exchange of nutrients from the outside and waste products
from the inside. Generally, the outermost surface of both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria presents capsular polysaccharides (CPS),23,24 which can have different structures within the same bacterial species
and can, therefore, be used for serotyping. Gram-negative bacteria
present an outer membrane (OM) to which lipopolysaccharides (LPS),
CPS, and proteins are attached (Figure 1). A thin layer of peptidoglycan is located between
the OM and the inner cytoplasmic cell membrane. In contrast, Gram-positive
bacteria lack an OM and are surrounded by a much thicker layer of
peptidoglycans as compared to Gram-negative bacteria.8 CPS are known virulence factors and are typically made
of highly hydrophilic, often negatively charged, long-chain polysaccharides,
anchored to the cell membrane, to the peptidoglycans, or to membrane
components.25 Their hydrophilic character
protects microorganisms from desiccation during transmission from
host to host. CPS may also mediate adhesion to abiotic surfaces and
to each other, promoting the formation of biofilms, conferring protection
against specific and nonspecific host immunity. They display a vast
structural diversity, that is brought by numerous different composing
monosaccharides, varying types of glycosidic linkages, and different
substituents such as acetyl groups, phosphates, and pyruvate ketals.
Examples of the enormous structural diversity of CPS include the 80
different capsular serotypes of E. coli, the more
than 90 serotypes of S. pneumoniae, and the 70 capsular
serotypes reported for K. pneumoniae.26

Surface glycans commonly found on Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. Gram-positives lack an outer membrane and present a thick
peptidoglycan (PG) layer, to which lipoteichoic (LTA) and wall teichoic
acids (WTA) are connected. The Gram-negative bacterial cell wall features
two membranes and a thin PG layer. Both can be surrounded by capsular
polysaccharide (CPS). The Gram-negative outer membrane is decorated
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or a truncated form lacking of the O-antigen,
termed lipooligosaccharide (LOS).

The OM of Gram-negative bacteria is an asymmetrical lipid bilayer,
which has phospholipids on the inner side while the outside is densely
functionalized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS),27 which is responsible for the endotoxic shock associated with septicemia.

LPS consists of three parts: lipid A, the core oligosaccharide,
and the O-specific side chains known as O-antigens (OAg) or O-polysaccharides.
Lipid A is the most conserved part, shares structural similarity between
most LPS, and consists of a glucosamine disaccharide substituted with
fatty acids, whose acyl chains enable tight packing of the OM, contributing
to its barrier function. Lipid A carries the endotoxic properties
of the LPS. The core oligosaccharide is divided into two regions:
the inner core, consisting of 2-keto-3-deoxy-octulosonic acid (Kdo)
and l-glycero-d-mannoheptose residues, that is highly
conserved, and the outer core, which displays some structural diversity
and which consists mainly of hexose sugars. The OAg domain is made
up of repeating units of one or more sugar residues and exhibits remarkable
structural diversity. Variations in its composition are often the
basis for serotype classification. The OAg is an important virulence
factor and helps the bacterium to escape the complement system and
to resist environmental stresses.28 Some
bacterial species, such as Neisseria spp., are unable
to synthesize OAg but produce a form of LPS which is referred to as
lipooligosaccharide (LOS), that contains an inner core from which
one or more oligosaccharide branches extend.29

Differently from Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria
lack the OM but are surrounded by a thick layer of peptidoglycan (PG).
PG has numerous important functions, the most important being stabilization
of the cell wall, enabling it to withstand high internal osmotic pressure.
PG is made up of repeating units of the disaccharide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid, which are
cross-linked by pentapeptide side chains.30 Gram-positive bacteria expose teichoic acids (TAs), zwitterionic
glycopolymers containing phosphodiester-linked polyol repeating units.31 TAs play a crucial role in cell shape determination,
regulation of cell division, and other aspects of Gram-positive bacterial
physiology. They can be divided in two major classes: lipoteichoic
acids (LTAs), anchored in the bacterial membrane via a glycolipid,
and wall teichoic acids (WTAs), covalently attached to PG. WTAs consist
of two parts: a disaccharide unit highly conserved across bacterial
species, which is connected at the reducing end to the PG via a phosphodiester
linkage, and a main chain polymer composed of phosphodiester-linked
polyol repeating units, most commonly 1,5-d-ribitol phosphate
(RibP) or (1–3)-sn-1-glycerol-phosphate (GroP).32 The structural diversity of WTA can derive from
the presence or absence of substituents attached to the backbone,
including cationic d-alanine esters and a variety of mono-
or oligosaccharides, most commonly glucose (Glc) or N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc).33 LTAs typically
consist of a poly-sn-3-glycerolphosphate chain that
can be decorated with d-alanine residues as well as different
carbohydrates.34

Numerous pathogenic
bacteria also synthesize and secrete exopolysaccharides
as part of the biofilm matrix, a slime composed of extracellular material
embedding the bacterial cells. Biofilms protect the microbial community
from environmental stresses, allowing resistance to bacteriophages,
amoebae, host immune responses, and antibiotics.35

Many extracellular polysaccharides are polyanionic,
such as alginate,
xanthan, and colanic acid. Polycationic exopolysaccharides also exist,
such as PNAG, a polymer of β-(1–6)-N-acetylglucosamine secreted by many pathogens including Staphylococcus
aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.36Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one
of the most studied biofilm forming pathogens, and it produces at
least three distinct exopolysaccharides which are involved in biofilm
formation: alginate, Pel, and Psl. Alginate is high molecular weight,
unbranched heteropolymer consisting of (1–4)-linked β-d-mannuronates and α-l-guluronates, and it is
involved in the establishment of microcolonies at the beginning of
biofilm formation. Pel is a cationic galactosamine-rich polysaccharide,
essential for biofilm formation, while Psl consists of a repeating
pentasaccharide containing d-mannose, d-glucose,
and l-rhamnose and has been shown to be involved in the adherence
to biotic and abiotic surfaces.37 Carbohydrates
are also abundant on the surface of fungi. Similar to bacteria, fungal
cell walls are composed of chemically different carbohydrate polymers
forming a robust scaffold that incorporates a variety of proteins
and other surface components, conferring flexibility. The majority
of fungal cell walls is constituted by a conserved inner layer and
a more heterogeneous outer layer. The inner layer is a core of chitin
and β-(1–3) glucan polymers with β-(1–6)
branches (about 60%) forming intrachain hydrogen bonds.38 The outer layer of the fungal cell wall comprises
proteins and/or other polysaccharides whose composition may vary with
the fungal species. For example, the outermost glycan layer of Candida albicans is composed of mannans.39

Glycoconjugate vaccines are most commonly prepared
using polysaccharides, which are extracted from bacteria, purified,
and coupled to a carrier protein through random linkages along the
saccharide chain (Figure 2A). This results in the formation of high molecular weight,
cross-linked, heterogeneous, and rather undefined structures.4,40,41 Carriers currently used in licensed
vaccines include tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid (DT), CRM197, the outer membrane protein complex of meningococcus B
(OMPC), Protein D from H. influenzae, and the recombinant
exotoxin A of P. aeruginosa.42−45 One of the most commonly used
chemistries for conjugation involves NaIO4 oxidation of
the polysaccharides, generating aldehydes from cis-diols, that can be used for reductive amination with amine groups
of the protein.46−48 Also 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate
(CDAP) chemistry is often exploited to randomly activate hydroxyl
groups of polysaccharides for subsequent direct condensation with
amines of the protein or the incorporation of linker moieties, such
as dihydrazine adipate, for further reaction with carboxylic acid
residues of the protein.49

Approaches for manufacturing
of glycans for vaccine development
based on (A) bacterial fermentation, including classic polysaccharide
extraction from pathogens and Protein Glycan Coupling Technology (PGCT)
and (B) total synthesis of oligosaccharides via solution phase chemical/chemoenzymatic
approaches or solid phase automated synthesis.

Better defined glycoconjugate vaccines can be generated by using
shorter oligosaccharides, obtained by chemical (using acidic or oxidative
conditions) or mechanical polysaccharide fragmentation, followed by
size fractionation. These fragments can be linked directly to the
protein either through the end-reducing sugar or via a spacer (Figure 2A).50−52 Classic and emerging methods for conjugation of poly- or oligosaccharides
to protein carriers have been recently thoroughly reviewed.53

Other approaches to obtain glycoconjugate
vaccines include the
so-called “protein glycan coupling technology” (PGCT)
or “bioconjugation”,54 which
is based on the genetic engineering of the E. coli Wxx-Wzy biosynthetic pathway to express a glycoprotein containing
a heterologous polysaccharide. This is achieved by incorporating the
genome clusters of choice in E. coli, along with
the oligosaccharyl transferase PglB from Campylobacter jejuni and a plasmid or gene encoding for the carrier protein carrying
the N-glycosylation consensus sequence D/E-N-X-S/T, where X can be
any amino acid except proline.55−57

This methodology has been
successfully applied to advance vaccines
against Shigella spp. (Limmatech Biologics)58 and extra intestinal pathogenic E. coli (Janssen/J&J).59 The translational
machinery of E. coli has also been engineered to
express proteins with unnatural (i.e. not naturally found or encoded)
amino acids (uAAs) to provide specific groups for conjugation.60 The inverse demand Diels–Alder reaction
between tetrazine functionalized glycans and genetically encoded trans-cyclooctene
or bicyclononyne-modified uAAs has been used for conjugation, either
in cellular media or in lysates.61 Based
on the “XtractCF” system, which enables the production
of proteins displaying uAAs for subsequent click chemistry with carbohydrates,
Vaxcyte (former Sutrovax) is currently developing a pneumococcal 24-valent
conjugate vaccine.62

Another emerging
approach is based on the protein capsular matrix
vaccine (PCMV; Matrivax) technology to connect the glycan and protein
components in a nonconventional manner. In this approach a biotinylated
polysaccharide and the carrier protein fused with a streptavidin domain
are crosslinked in a matrix.63 This technology
has been used by Affinivax for a prototype 24-valent pneumococcal
vaccine, which was demonstrated to provide protection against invasive
disease and carriage in mice64 and has
been advanced to phase II clinical trials, where it was shown to be
well tolerated and immunogenic in an adult population (Table 1).65

Regardless of the approach used, the immunological activity
of
the glycoconjugates is influenced by a variety of factors, including
the nature and length of the carbohydrate, the substitution pattern,
and the number of glycans attached to the protein (i.e. the saccharide/protein
ratio).4

This review will focus on
glycoconjugates obtained from synthetic
glycans (Figure 2B).
Because of their well-defined length and composition, synthetic glycans
offer clear advantages in the elucidation of the parameters impacting
the immunogenicity of glycoconjugate vaccines.66 In addition, synthetic glycans are typically assembled
with a linker preinstalled at the downstream end of the oligosaccharides,
allowing conjugation to the protein with preservation of the integrity
of all sugar moieties. Numerous methodologies for fast assembly of
oligosaccharides, including one-pot protocols67 in solution phase, enzymatic approaches,68 and solid phase automated synthesis,69−71 have now become available.
Site-selective conjugation methods have also been developed to direct
this step to preselected sites on carrier proteins, which enables
investigations into the impact of the position of the glycan on the
protein carrier on the activity of the glycoconjugates.72,73 We will first provide examples how synthetic chemistry can be used
to improve existing vaccines and then continue to outline the progress
that has been made to generate vaccines to combat AMR.

H. influenzae is a Gram-negative coccobacillus
part of the nasopharynx microbiota in healthy adults, children, and
infants.74 Serotype b (Hib) causes severe
diseases in humans such as epiglottitis, sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis.
The Hib CPS is made up of poly(ribosyl ribitolphosphate) (PRP) repeating
units (RUs) and represents the most important virulence factor.75 PRP was conjugated to a diphtheria toxoid (DT)
protein in 1983, resulting in the first glycoconjugate vaccine ever
developed.76,77 Currently, different Hib glycoconjugate
vaccines with different carrier proteins are available on the EU and
US market, either in single form or in combination with other vaccines
(Table 1).78,79 Quimi-Hib (1, Figure 3) is based on a synthetic PRP and has been licensed
in Cuba in 2004. It is composed of a synthetic antigen with an average
of seven RP repeating units conjugated to a thiolated TT carrier protein
through a 3-(maleimido)-propylamide linker.18 This vaccine represents the first licensed glycoconjugate vaccine
based on a synthetic carbohydrate antigen. The large scale production
of the PRP fragments was achieved through a one-step polycondensation
reaction using H-phosphonate chemistry, where the spacer containing
end residue (2) and H-phosphonate derivative (3) were oligomerized in a pivaloyl chloride mediated polycondensation.

Synthetic
polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP) antigen of Quimi-Hib,
the first synthetic glycan-based vaccine for prevention of Haemophilus influenzae type b, is produced by a controlled
polycondensation of a H-phosphonate building block.

Over the years, different methods have been developed to
obtain
Hib oligosaccharides by depolymerization of natural polysaccharide48,77,80,81 and by chemical synthesis.82−84

Recently, Baek et al. synthesized
oligomers ranging in length from
a tetramer up to a decamer, using a [2+2] elongation strategy in an
iterative approach involving a ribosyl-ribitol acceptor, with the
ribitol C5-OH acting as the nucleophile, and a ribosyl-ribitol C-3′-H-phosphonate
aminopentyl donor, in line with the approach taken to construct the
Quimi-Hib vaccine antigen.85 The CRM197 conjugates of the obtained oligosaccharides were used to
immunize Zika-rabbits, and the sera were analyzed using a glycan array.

The tetramer and octamer revealed the highest immunogenicity although
no linear or marked length-dependent trend could be shown. This study
suggests that four repeating units would fully cover the Hib polysaccharide
epitope and represent an optimal length for vaccine design.

Similarly to other phosphodiester bridged polymers, Hib polysaccharide
suffers from intrinsic lability, especially in the presence of metal
cations. The hydrolysis of the phosphodiester linkages has been explained
with a mechanism involving the 2-OH of the ribose moiety;86 therefore, analogues with different functional
groups (e.g. -OCH3 and -F) to replace
the 2-OH have been developed, resulting in higher stability.87 In the post-Hib vaccine era, other serotypes
and nontypeable strains (NTHi) are emerging as a significant cause
of invasive infections and meningitis.88H. influenzae serotype a (Hia) represents the second
most virulent capsular serotype of H. influenzae,
especially in children aged six months to two years, and it can cause
meningitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and bacteremia.74 The Hia capsule is a polymer of glucose and
ribitol connected by phosphodiester linkages. The synthesis of oligomers
up to two repeating units was reported in 1988 and was achieved through
condensation of an α-d-glucopyranosyl
bromide derivative with 5-O-allyl-1,2,3-tri-O-benzyl-d-ribitol, followed by phosphorylation
and removal of protective groups.89 Development
of Hia vaccines should be technically feasible, but a limited market
would likely require donor support to incentivize a manufacturer.90 An approach similar to the Hib oligomers can
be envisaged. Considering the structural and infectious similarities
between Hia and Hib serotypes, the success of Hib vaccination could
suggest a rational background for the development of a Hia glycoconjugate
vaccine protective both in adults and infants.91 Indeed, a CPS-based glycoconjugate vaccine has shown promising
results, and it is at an early stage of development.92 In silico studies have recently shown important conformational
differences between the serotype a and b polysaccharides, explaining
the lack of cross-reactivity, justifying the need for a separate conjugate
vaccine to target Hia.92

Efforts in
the generation of meningococcal vaccines have been directed
to the pathogen-free production of structures identical to the natural
glycans and to the design of glycomimetics with improved stability.
The serotype A CPS is composed of (1–6)-linked N-acetyl-α-d-mannosamine-1-phosphates with acetyl esters
at C-3 or C-4 (Figure 4).

Meningococcal capsular polysaccharide structures and related synthetic
conjugates. On the right the structure of the repeating unit of the
natural CPS is described. Synthetic structures include copies of the
natural polysaccharide (4–6) and
analogues (7 and 8). In conjugate (6) the 11-mer molecule was obtained in a one-pot fashion
using the enzymatic elongation of a synthetic acceptor.

The synthesis of a nonacetylated MenA CPS up to a trimer
has been
achieved using a 2-azido mannosamine H-phosphonate building block
using pivaloyl chloride mediated condensations followed by iodine
oxidation of the intermediate phosphites.93 A 3-O-acetylated MenA tetramer was successfully
assembled using a 3-O-acetyl-2-azido-4-O-benzyl-6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-2-deoxy-α-d-mannopyranosyl H-phosphonate.94 The TT conjugate obtained incorporated an S-acetylthioglycolic
linker for subsequent thiol-maleimide addition and inhibited the binding
of anti-MenA PS serum to the capsular PS.

Synthetic routes have
also been exploited for other serotypes.
The MenX CPS is composed of (1–6)-linked N-acetyl-α-d-glucosamine-1-phosphates (Figure 4), and a MenX CPS trimer was
synthesized from a 2-azide glucose building block using H-phoshonate
chemistry.95 Fragments ranging in length
from a monomer to a trimer were obtained and conjugated to CRM197 using active ester chemistry. Only the trimer conjugate
induced bactericidal anti-MenX PS antibodies in mice.96 Subsequently a tetramer fragment was generated,97 and a competitive ELISA showed that the corresponding
TT conjugate was a much better competitor than the unconjugated form,
indicating the need for longer length CPS fragments to sufficiently
emulate the PS epitope. Recently, the structural epitope of the MenX
CPS was mapped using a Fab derived from a murine bactericidal monoclonal
antibody (mAb) obtained against the conjugated MenX PS.98 Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC), and STD-NMR showed binding for a fragment
longer than 5 RUs. In silico docking with a hexamer and the structure
of the Fab resolved by X-ray crystallography confirmed binding through
a network of salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions. Upon conjugation,
5 RUs were sufficient to elicit functional antibody levels at a level
comparable to a longer 10 RU fragment, suggesting that glycoconjugates
with relatively short structures can be used for vaccine development.

Recent progress in the construction of the challenging α-sialic
acid linkage has enabled access to polysialic acid MenC structures.99 An N5,O4-carbonyl-protected
α-sialyl phosphate donor was a key intermediate for the assembly
of α-(2–9)-linked oligoasialic acids up to a dodecamer.100,101 Conjugates with KLH (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin) induced murine antibodies
recognizing MenC cells in ELISA. Recently, a synthetic MenC tetramer
and octamer were assembled and conjugated with TT, inducing in mice
bactericidal IgGs at a level comparable to a licensed vaccine.102 A fully synthetic MenC-glycan antigen linked
to a monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) carrier (4) has also
been generated and shown to elicit good levels of bactericidal antibodies.103 The MenW CPS is composed of →6)-α-d-Gal-(1–4)-α-d-Neu5Ac-(2→ repeats,
and the synthesis of MenW CPS fragments up to the length of a decamer
was accomplished using a sialylated galactosyl disaccharide thiophenyl
building block.104 Conjugated oligomers
induced an immune response in mice against themselves, with the octamer
providing the most bactericidal serum against a MenW135 strain. Differently
from ACWYX capsular polysaccharides that have been successfully advanced
as vaccine antigens, MenB CPS, composed of a →8)-α-d-Neu5Ac-(2→ repeating unit, exhibits high similarity
with gangliosides expressed during fetal development (GD3) and involved
in neural growth.105 Although an N-propionyl sialyl conjugate vaccine generated in a preclinical
model106 antibodies not or minimally cross-reactive
with purified human glycans,107 safety
concerns have prevented the use of MenB CPS for clinical applications.

As an alternative to the use of CPS, the use of a highly conserved
LPS portion has been considered. A model vaccine, constructed by conjugation
of a deacetylated truncated LPS form to CRM197 through
the Kdo residue was able to elicit anti-LPS antibodies in both rabbits
and mice.108 However, the raised sera cross
reacted only with de-O-acylated LPS of MenB strains
but not with the native fully acylated LPS. Recently, the core tetrasaccharide
composed of two heptose residues and two Kdo saccharides (Hep2Kdo2),
a common motif shared by different pathogenic strains of N.
meningitidis but also P. aeruginosa and E. coli, has been synthesized.109 The related CRM197 conjugate raised murine antibodies,
which recognized in vitro the inner core of the LPS. Combination of
the antibodies with an inhibitor of capsular polysaccharide transport
enabled bacterial killing of MenB strains. This shows that the LPS
is effectively masked by CPS, and its use as a vaccine target remains
challenging. Today vaccines based on the outer membrane vesicle (OMV)
and the proteins, Bexsero and Trumemba, are available against MenB,110 as well as a bivalent MenB/MenC vaccine composed
of MenB, OMV, and MenC CPS (VamengocBC).111

Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of natural polysaccharides
have also been explored as powerful tools to simplify and accelerate
manufacturing of meningococcal CPS oligomers. The biosynthesis of
the MenA CPS consists of three steps: (i) the epimerization of UDP-GlcNAc
to UDP-ManNAc by the epimerase CsaA; (ii) the condensation of this
UDP donor at the C-6 of an ManNAc-1P acceptor by the polymerase CsaB;
and (iii) the acetylation of the assembled polymer by the acetyl transferase
CsaC. By cloning and expressing a soluble form of these three enzymes,
the biosynthesis of the MenA CPS was replicated in vitro, providing
structures identical to the native polysaccharide, in terms of both
structure and immunological activity.112 A synthetic disaccharide was required for priming the polymerase
reaction and allowing the enzymatic elongation of MenA CPS.

The mechanism of O-acetylation has been further
detailed by structural studies showing that the CsaC selectively transfers
an acetyl ester to the O3 position; however, part of the acetyl esters
migrates to the O4 position at neutral pH.113 This generates the typical acetylation pattern of MenA CPS that
is important for its immunogenicity. Similarly, the production of
MenX oligomers has been explored. The polymerase CsxA enabled elongation
of naturally derived acceptors and generation of oligomers that upon
conjugation to CRM197 elicited an immunogenic response
in mice comparable to the conjugated natural PS.114,115 Subsequently, an efficient chemoenzymatic approach was developed
by combining the chemical synthesis of a trisaccharide acceptor, equipped
with a linker for conjugation, and the enzymatic elongation through
a column immobi-lized truncated form of the polymerase CsxA.68

By passing the growing oligosaccharide
together with an immobilized
truncated form of the polymerase CsxA through a column68 with GlcNAc-UDP, a structure with an average
length of 12 RUs (6) was assembled and conjugated to
CRM197. Vaccination of mice elicited a high level of bactericidal
antibodies comparable to conjugates made from extracted material.
Compared to conventional synthetic protocols, this methodology proved
very expeditious and drastically reduced the number of purification
steps to generate the oligomers. A chemoenzymatic method has also
been developed for the synthesis of the MenC CPS. A spacer equipped
with synthetic lactosides was modified with two sialic acid residues
with a C. jejeuni transferase for further elongation
with the MenC sialyltransferase. A TT conjugate of the obtained oligo-(2–8)-sialyl
oligomers elicited a MenC CPS-specific immune response in mice.116

Recently, studies on the MenW capsular
polymerase (NmSiaDW) have
identified 4-azido-4-deoxy-N-acetylmannosamine and
6-azid-6-deoxy-N-acetylmannosamine as suitable substrates
for the synthesis of MenW oligosaccharides containing 4,7-di-N-acetylneuraminic acid and 4,9-di-N-acetylneuraminic
acid.117 Through these azide intermediates
an enzymatic strategy was developed to assemble the N-Ac-oligosaccharides up to a length of a pentasaccharide (5). Overall, these studies suggest that chemoenzymatic approaches
can be very versatile and they can likely be expanded to other sero
groups.

The MenA polysaccharide suffers from instability in
solution because
the anomeric phosphate is relatively easily cleaved, as the neighboring trans-oriented acetamide can participate in its displacement.
Therefore, the development and manufacture of a MenA glycoconjugate
vaccine in liquid formulation remains a challenge.118

Typically, this issue is solved by using lyophilized
formulations,
which are reconstituted with saline before use or by storage at 2–8
°C. This solution, however, implies extra costs for production
and distribution of the vaccine, particularly in areas where maintaining
the cold chain is not trivial, such as emerging and poor countries.
Therefore, stabilized analogues are desirable.

Analogues of
the MenA CPS have been designed by replacing the phosphodiesters
with a more stable C-phosphonate (Figure 4, compound (7).119,120

The critical installation of the interglycosidic phosphomonoester
linkages was accomplished using a Mitsunobu coupling of the glycosyl
C-phosphonate building block with the 6-OH moiety of the mannosamine
acceptor.119 C-phosphonate bridged oligomers
up to the trimer length (7) were conjugated to human
serum albumin (HSA), stimulating in vitro T-cell proliferation (CFSE
method) and IL-2 release (ELISA) and inducing in vivo anti-polysaccharide-specific
IgGs.120 In an alternative approach, so-called
“carba-analogues”, in which the mannosamine ring oxygen
is replaced by a methylene group, have been explored.121 These analogues are stabilized because the
lack of the ring oxygen precludes the formation of an oxocarbenium
ion-like species that would form upon cleavage of the anomeric C–O
phosphate bond and appear more suitable for large scale manufacturing
since phosphoramidite chemistry can be used for the construction of
the phosphate linkages.122 The key step
in the formation of the carbacycle analogue of mannosamine is the
Claisen rearrangement of a 6-methylene glucal. Short oligomers of
the carbaMenA analogues, containing up to three repeating units, were
initially generated using carba H-phosphonates (Figure 4, compound (8)).122 The carbaMenA trimer induced low levels of
antibodies, that cross-reacted with the native MenA CPS and showed
bactericidal activity. To explain the behavior of the carba analogues,
conformational modelling studies were undertaken. Molecular dynamics
simulations indicated the MenA CPS conformation to be a flexible random
coil which becomes less conformationally defined as the length increases.123 Acetylation would provide structural rigidity
to the MenA backbone. Also, the carbaMenA was predicted to present
a more random extended conformation as compared to the natural MenA.124 A more thorough investigation was performed
by combining theoretical calculations and NMR spectroscopy experiments,
using chemically synthesized 1- or 6-phophorylated monomannosamines
and their carba analogues as chemical probes.125

The data confirmed that in spite of a high conformational
freedom
of the key pseudoglycosidic and aglycon torsion angles in the carba
analogues, one of the favorable geometries corresponds to that of
the natural monomer.

To improve the immunogenicity of the carbaMenA
oligomers, more
recently, structures up to eight repeating units in length were assembled.126 Non-O-acetylated 6- and 8-mers
conjugated to CRM197 elicited in mice anti-MenA CPS antibodies
but still at suboptimal levels. However, the 8-mer showed the unique
capacity to recognize a bactericidal murine mAb that previously had
been shown by STD NMR and X-ray crystallography to bind to an O-acetylated trisaccharide epitope.127 The introduction of O-acetyl groups in
the carbaMenA octamer (8) through a controlled random
acetylation reaction led to an O-acetylation degree of 75%, similar
to the natural polysaccharide. Conjugation of this antigen led to
a model vaccine, that induced bactericidal antibodies to a level comparable
to the MenA vaccine benchmark.126 This
work represents an important proof-of-principle for the use of glycomimetics
as more stable alternatives for polysaccharide-based vaccines.

Novel concepts have been tested with natural CPS, and these could
be further exploited for the synthetic structures. Conjugation of
oligosaccharides from two diverse sero groups, namely MenA and C,
has been shown to induce high titers of bactericidal antibodies against
the two different sero groups after the third administration.128

The MenA CPS seems to suffer from carrier
epitope suppression as
a result of preexisting immunity to the protein carrier, in particular
CRM197 and TT.45 The use of
alternative carriers, such as the pneumococcal Spr96-2021, has been
explored.129 Genetically detoxified outer
membrane vesicles (GMMA) from MenB have also been introduced as a
potent carrier for MenA and MenC polysaccharides, giving levels of
murine bactericidal antibodies superior to CRM197 already
at the first dose..130 Finally, MenC polysaccharide
conjugated to full-length hepatitis B core (HBc) antigen virus-like
particles using heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol linkers generated
10-fold higher anti-carbohydrate IgGs than the unconjugated polysaccharide
and increased IgG2a subclass production with a shift to a Th1 cellular
immune type response.131

Despite vaccines
being available in developed countries, the Institute
for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that S.
pneumoniae accounts for 1.2 million deaths and approximately
900,000 disabled patients annually from pneumonia and meningitis.
In addition, S. pneumoniae is responsible for an
estimated 36% of the global burden of pneumonia and 27% of the global
burden of otitis media. A priority for pneumococcal vaccination is
to increase the global distribution in poor and emerging countries.
Some years after introduction of PCV7, a clear impact of vaccination
on community acquired pneumoniae was observed;132 however, an increase of invasive pneumoniae disease (IPD)
of non-PCV7 serotypes was observed. Although these events were far
below the magnitude of the reduction in IPD caused by the vaccine
serotypes,133 this highlights the need
for broader coverage in the countries where a vaccine is available.

Additional challenges associated with pneumococcal vaccination
have been the low immunogenicity of some glycoconjugates in the complex
multivalent formulation (e.g. serotype (ST) 3) and
the unexpected lack of cross protection between some structurally
similar polysaccharides (e.g. ST19A and 19F).

Synthetic chemistry has been a fundamental means to generate glycans
for the identification of key polysaccharide epitopes and the improvement
of pneumococcal vaccines, particularly for the most challenging serotypes.
This topic has been recently thoroughly reviewed,134−137 so we will here only give an overview of the most relevant concepts
developed through synthetic carbohydrate derived glycoconjugates to
obtain vaccine candidates at the preclinical level. The seminal work
of Vliegenthart and Kamerling was pivotal to demonstrate that the
immunogenic character of long and complex polysaccharides can be related
to short defined glycan epitopes. KLH conjugates of di-, tri-, and
tetrasaccharide fragments of serotype 6A and 6B were synthesized and
shown to elicit high levels of ST6B antibodies in rabbits, that facilitated
type-specific phagocytosis (Figure 5).138 The rabbit antisera
raised against the tri- and tetrasaccharide also reacted with the
6A PS in an ELISA assay and promoted phagocytosis of 6A pneumococci.
All rabbit antisera passively protected mice against a ST6B challenge.
In mice, however, phagocytic and protective anti-ST6B antibodies were
only induced by the tetrasaccharide conjugate, and these antibodies
did not cross-react with ST6A PS in an ELISA. Overall, these studies
have shown that the tetrasaccharide (13) was capable
of inducing ST6B-specific, fully protective antibodies in two animal
models. Likewise, through a library of ST14 derived structures, a
branched tetrasaccharide repeating unit (15) was shown
to be the functional minimal epitope in a mouse model.139,140 This small epitope, that recently has been readily assembled also
by automated synthesis,141 has become a
model to obtain a fully synthetic vaccine based on gold nanoparticles
where T-cell help is provided by a synthetic peptide.142 A polysaccharide mimic composed of a sequential
synthetic tetrasaccharide unit connected through a linker has been
made and shown to be immunogenic in mice.143 A hexasaccharide conjugated to BSA induced apparently both innate
(through TLR2 activation) and humoral responses in mice, with longer
antibody persistence when aluminum hydroxide was used as adjuvant.
However, the TLR2 expression on spleen cells from immunized mice seems
not specific and caused by cytokine action rather than being the outcome
of a ligand–receptor interaction.144 A synthetic ST14 tetrasaccharide was site selectively linked via
a thiol–maleimide coupling to four different pneumococcal surface
adhesin A (PsaA) mutants, each harboring a single cysteine mutation
at a defined position.145 Antibody responses
to both the carbohydrate and PsaA protein antigens were generated
in mice. Various other pneumococcal structures have more recently
been synthesized. Synthetically made zwitterionic polysaccharides
from ST1 have been generated by different research groups.146−149 This serotype has attracted attention for its property to elicit
T-cell responses without conjugation.150 An elegant strategy for insertion of a benzylthio linker in the
trisaccharide of ST1, to release a thiol group for conjugation at
the end of the assembly under Birch debenzylation conditions, enabled
the chemoselective conjugation to a carrier protein as well as a glycan
array surface, preserving potential protective epitopes.148 The CRM197 conjugate of the trisaccharide (9) induced a robust antibody response in rabbit compared
to the PCV13 commercial vaccine, that was used as a control, and it
reduced the blood bacterial load of mice in a passive immunization
approach using pooled rabbit serum.148 The
assembly of structures up to four repeating units showed that the
longer synthetic structures adopt helical structures with approximately
eight monosaccharides completing a full turn. It was also shown that
the oligomers encompassing three RUs (nine monosaccharides) bound
monoclonal antibodies, raised against the deacetylated native CPS,
much better than shorter fragments. There, thus, seems to be a correlation
between the secondary structure and antibody binding activity. An
outstanding issue remains the introduction of O-acetyl
groups, that have been shown to be an important structural feature,
but the introduction of these groups, alongside the carboxylic acids,
acetamides, and free amines in the structure, represents a significant
synthetic challenge.

Pneumococcal vaccine candidates based on synthetic glycans.
Synthetic
oligosaccharides mimicking several Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes (ST) have been synthesized and tested at the preclinical
level to identify key glycan epitopes.

Conjugates of synthetic fragments of serotype 3 PS of different
lengths (up to a tetramer) have been prepared and conjugated to different
carriers, including TT, KLH, and CRM197.151−153 The CRM197 conjugates of the di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides
of ST3 were shown to be protective in mice against a challenge with
ST3.151 Parameswarappa et al. showed that
a tetrasaccharide exhibited the highest recognition of human anti
PS serum on a glycan array, outperforming shorter fragments, and this
structure was selected for conjugation to CRM197, to deliver
a model vaccine (10) that induced protection against
ST3 in a mouse model.154

Oligosaccharides
deviating from the serotypes included in the PCV13
vaccine have been targeted, and this has aided in gaining relevant
structural information on key epitopes of these glycans. A synthetic
hexasaccharide repeating unit of the ST2 CPS was selected from a set
of different structures, based on glycan microarray screening.155 Vaccination with the hexasaccharide linked
to CRM197 (11) stimulated a T-cell-dependent
B-cell response and induced CPS-specific opsonic antibodies in mice,
resulting in killing of encapsulated bacteria by phagocytic activity.
In addition, the neoglycoconjugate reduced the bacterial load in lung
and blood of mice, transnasally challenged with the highly virulent
ST2 strain NCTC 7466.

The combination of automated glycan assembly
(AGA) and glycan microarray-based
monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding studies has been used to identify
a protective glycan epitope from ST8.156 Out of four structures, a tetrasaccharide frameshift was shown to
be preferentially recognized by a protective anti-natural PS mAb and
this structure was conjugated to CRM197. The ST8 neoglycoconjugate (14) induced an antibacterial immune response also in coformulation
with the commercial PCV13, demonstrating the feasibility of a vaccine
with extended coverage based on mixed synthetic and naturally derived
carbohydrates.

A combination of ST2, 3, 5, 8, and 14 glycoconjugates
(sPCV5),
all obtained by chemical synthesis, has been shown to give high levels
of specific protective antibodies against the different serotypes
in rabbits.157 All STs in sPCV5 induced
immune responses comparable to the licensed control vaccines, except
ST14, which led to a lower response. Coformulation with PCV13 and
PCV10 also led to a robust protective immune response in this animal
model, highlighting the potential of a fully synthetic carbohydrate-based
multivalent vaccine as well as the combination of conjugates from
chemical synthesis and polysaccharide extraction.

Stabilization
of conjugates susceptible to degradation has been
proposed as a way to improve vaccine performance. The ST5 repeating
unit contains two rare sugars, the ketoamino sugar 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-xylose-hexos-4-ulose (Sugp) and N-acetyl-l-pneumosamine (l-PneuNAc). The keto group of Sugp can cause degradation of the natural polysaccharide.158 A set of structures equipped with a linker
was synthesized, and through a glycan array, a penta- and a tetrasaccharide
both containing the immune dominant l-PneuNAc and a terminal l-FucNAc (thus lacking the vulnerable C-4-ketone) were selected
for conjugation.158 Studies in rabbit showed
that a pentasaccharide (12), presenting an additional
β-Glc, induced a higher level of opsonic antibodies in comparison
to the conjugated tetrasaccharide. Notably, the identified oligosaccharide
epitope is devoid of the residues that are responsible for the product
instability.

The two structurally similar polysaccharides 19A
and 19F have also
attracted a lot of attention because of the unexpected lack of cross-reactivity
observed with PCV17, containing ST19F, with ST19A PS. Along with the
synthesis of the individual serotype fragments,159 the identification of cross-protective epitopes has been
pursued. A chimeric oligosaccharide antigen (16) containing
the repeating units of ST19A and ST19F has been assembled, and its
glycoconjugate induced good levels of antibodies in rabbits that killed
ST19A and ST19F bacteria in vitro.160 By
testing a series of synthetic short glycans, a shared ManNAc-β-(1–4)-Glc
epitope, carrying a phosphate at the ManNAc-C4 has been identified,161 although the immunogenicity of this epitope
was not investigated.

Gold nanoparticles have also been used
to combine glycans from
two different serotypes onto the same carrier. Vetro et al. described
the functionalization of gold nanoparticles with the tetrasaccharide
epitope of ST14, the trisaccharide repeating unit of ST19F along with
a T-helper peptide and a d-Glc, as a hydrophilic “filler”
molecule.162 This conjugate induced specific
IgG antibodies in mice against the type 14 polysaccharide but not
against the ST19F. This could either indicate that the conjugated
ST19F fragment was suboptimal or that immune interference between
the two glycans led to suppression of the response against this serotype.

A. baumannii, a commensal Gram-negative bacterium,
is an important source of hospital acquired infections, and extremely
drug-resistant strains have emerged.163 Intensive care patients and patients receiving mechanical ventilation
are at risk of developing lung infections, urinary tract infections,
bacteremia, endocarditis, skin infections, and meningitidis.164 The high mortality and morbidity of A. baumannii infections are a strong incentive for the development
of alternative treatments, such as active or passive vaccination strategies,
and whole cell vaccines, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), as well as
protein-based vaccines are under development.165A. baumannii shows an extremely diverse
CPS repertoire, with many different serotypes expressing unique structures.
Passive immunization strategies using a monoclonal antibody against
the K1 capsular polysaccharide,166 a polymer
built up from [ →3)-β-d-QuiNAc4NR-(1–4)-α-d-GlcNAc6OAc-(1–4)-α-d-GalNAcA-(1 →]
repeats, with the quinovose residue carrying an acetyl or 3-hydroxybutyrate
residue at the C-4-amine, are under development.167

The extraordinary biodiversity of the A.
baumannii polysaccharides,168 of
which more than 40 different structures have been reported, poses
tremendous challenges to their syntheses. Although they serve as a
source of inspiration for the development of new synthetic methodologies,
conjugation-ready A. baumannii oligosaccharides with
application in initial immunology studies have not been reported.
Wu and co-workers have reported that the natural polysaccharide of
strain 54149 (a strain that was isolated from IC patients) could be
depolymerized by the tail spike protein of bacteriophage ΦAB6TSP
to generate an octasaccharide, comprising two tetrasaccharide repeating
units of the polymer. These repeating units are built up of [→3)-β-GalNAcp-(1–3)-[β-Glcp-(1–6)]-β-Galp-(1→]
repeating units with the characteristic pseudaminic acid residues
at the C-6 of the glucose residue.169 This
octasaccharide (17) was conjugated to CRM197 by formation of the anomeric hemiaminal, reaction with dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl
propionate) (DTSSP), dithiothreitol (DTT) mediated reduction of the
disulfide, and addition to maleimide functionalized CRM197 (Figure 6). Immunization
of rabbits with conjugate (18) (4 boosts in 2 weeks)
gave serum capable of recognizing A. baumannii 54149
CPS and (17). Cross-reactivity of this serum with other
strains was less than the cross reactivity of sera raised using the
native polysaccharide. The pseudaminic acid residue was shown to be
a crucial binding motif for the antibodies in the sera, which showed
adequate bactericidal activity.169

Clostridioides
difficile, also known as C. difficile, is
a Gram-positive species of spore forming
bacteria that causes severe diarrhea and inflammation of the colon
such as colitis.170C. difficile infection (CDI) is a global health threat with a high incidence
in both hospitals and communities. It is estimated that C.
difficile causes nearly half a million infections in the
US annually with associated health care costs over $5 billion.171 CDI is associated with a high risk of recurrence
(approximately 60% after three or more episodes of infection), even
in the absence of additional risk factors, such as antibiotics or
exposure to the bacterium.172

The
main risk factor for CDI is the imbalance of the microbiota, which
leads to the disruption of its barrier effect, mainly due to systemic
exposure to antibiotics. CDI affects elderly people with comorbidities,
patients undergoing surgery, long-term hospitalized patients, and
immunocompromised patients. The main virulence factors of C. difficile are two large exotoxins, toxins A and B (TcdA
and TcdB, respectively), which are important mediators of intestinal
damage and disease. In addition to these toxins, several surface components
have been characterized as colonization factors, and these have been
shown to be immunogenic.173

On the
cell surface of C. difficile, three cell-wall
polysaccharides, PSI, PSII, and PSIII, that are essential for bacterial
survival and virulence, were identified and structurally characterized.174,175 PSI is expressed at low levels on the cell surface, and it is unclear
whether it is present in different C. difficile strains,
while PSII and PSIII appear to be conserved surface polysaccharide
antigens across the majority of C. difficile strains.176 PSI is a polymer of branched pentasaccharide
phosphate repeats, composed of rhamnose, glucose, and phosphate. PSII
is made up of a hexasaccharide phosphate repeat of glucose, mannose,
and N-acetyl-galactosamine constituents. PSIII is
a water-insoluble lipoteichoic acid-like glycan, composed of phosphate, N-acetyl-glucosamine, and glyceric acid with minor repetitions
of glucose and glycerol portions in the reducing regions.174 In 2013 Martin et al. synthesized the pentasaccharide
repeating unit of PSI and oligosaccharide substructures by applying
a linear synthesis strategy from monosaccharide building blocks following
the strategy schematically depicted in Figure 7.177 The synthetic
PSI repeating unit conjugated to CRM197 was shown to be
capable of inducing immunoglobulin class switching as well as affinity
maturation in mice. A disaccharide motif was identified as the minimal
epitope, recognizing antibodies from serum and stools from CDI patients.

(A) Chemical
structures of C. difficile PSI, PSII,
and PSIII. (B) Synthetic routes for PSI and related fragments have
been developed enabling identification of the disaccharide epitope
(26).

The synthesis of the
PSI pentasaccharide repeating unit and conjugation
to a subunit of C. difficile exotoxin B to yield
a potential dual vaccine were reported by Monteiro’s team.178 Sera from healthy horses were shown to contain
natural anti-PSI IgG antibodies that detected both the synthetic nonphosphorylated
PSI repeat and the native PSI polysaccharide, with a slightly higher
recognition of the native PSI polysaccharide. Adamo and co-workers
synthesized the hexasaccharide repeating unit of PSII, with and without
the phosphate group at the nonreducing end, using a convergent [4+2]
approach.179 The synthetic hexasaccharides
were conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein and evaluated
in mice, showing that the hexasaccharide with the phosphate group
was able to elicit IgG antibodies that recognized PSII on the surface
of C. difficile cells, while the nonphosphorylated
hexasaccharide induced neither IgG nor IgM antibodies (Figure 8).180 The synthesis of the nonphosphorylated hexasaccharide has also been
achieved by Seeberger and co-workers, who conjugated the glycan to
CRM197 using squaric acid chemistry. The conjugate was
capable of inducing carbohydrate-specific antibodies in mice, which
bound to the hexasaccharide immobilized on a glycan array.181

Antibodies in stool from patients were also probed. It was observed
that not all stool samples showed binding. This could be explained
by varying amounts of antibodies in the stool samples, occurrence
of CDI from a different serotype, or the need of the phosphate group
for higher affinity binding as reported above. In 2013, Seeberger’s
group reported the synthesis of phosphodiester bridged oligomers of
the PSIII repeating unit. A synthetic PSIII monomer and dimer, synthesized
using phosphoramidite chemistry, were immobilized on a glycan array
and used to detect anti-glycan antibodies in the sera of CDI patients.182 The PSIII dimer conjugated to CRM197 proved to be immunogenic and capable of protecting mice from a challenge
with C. difficile.183,184

Later,
the same team evaluated the protective efficacy of various
glycoconjugates prepared by linking the various synthetic glycans
to CRM197, demonstrating that PSI and PSIII conjugates
can reduce colonization in a murine model more effectively than an
antitoxin vaccine candidate.185 However,
no binding to C. difficile cells could be demonstrated
by flow cytometry, indicating that expression of the glycans was different
in the used in vitro setup, that binding was too weak, as described
above, or that cellular immune responses (as opposed to antibody mediated
effects) were responsible for the protective effect. Furthermore,
this study showed that the PSI, PSII, and PSIII glycoconjugates did
not significantly affect the murine gut microbiota, indicating that
the aroused antibodies are highly specific for C. difficile.

E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium of which most
strains are harmless commensal species. It is the most studied prokaryote
and the “work horse bacterium” in molecular biology,
microbiology, and biotechnology. Pathogenic E. coli strains, however, are causative agents of diarrhea disease, urinary
tract infections, and pyelonephritis and neonatal meningitidis,186 and pathogenic strains are emerging as the
primary cause of bacteremia and sepsis in the US187 and are associated with increasing AMR.188E. coli strains can be serotyped using
different antigens, including their O-antigens (based on the partial
structure of the lipopolysaccharides, of which currently >180 have
been established) and K-antigens (based on the structures of the capsular
polysaccharides, of which there are currently ∼80 reported).189

Particularly, E. coli O25 ST131, producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs),
has spread globally, becoming the dominant type among extraintestinal
isolates in many parts of the world.190

The development of vaccines against different strains has
taken
several approaches, including the use of attenuated pathogens and
the development of protein- and peptide-based vaccines.

Polysaccharides
have been used in the development of glycoconjugate
vaccines, that have been generated through conjugation of native polysaccharides
to carrier proteins using classic chemical conjugation or the in vivo
bioconjugation (PGCT) approach. A nine-valent bioconjugate vaccine
(ExPEC 9 V) is currently approaching phase III studies, after promising
immunogenicity data of nine out of ten conjugates tested in phase
II (Table 2).191 The broad structural variety of the E. coli O- and K-antigens has been an inspiration for the
development of effective syntheses to generate well-defined fragments
of these polysaccharides. The vast majority of these synthetic efforts,
however, generated stand-alone saccharides, not suitable for the generation
of glycoconjugate vaccines. Li and co-workers reported on the assembly
of a core R3 pentasaccharide that was used to generate a conjugate
vaccine.192 The core oligosaccharides of E. coli lipopolysaccharides show limited variation—only
five are known, termed R1, R2, R3, R4, and K12—and therefore
represent attractive targets against which to direct the immune system. Figure 9 shows the structure
and synthetic strategy of the conjugation-ready R3 pentasaccharide
(32), built up from the common monosaccharides galactose,
glucose, and glucosamine.

Synthetic routes for conjugates of the E. coli O-antigen core pentasaccharide (A) and repeating
unit of O1 (B).
A conjugate of the core pentasaccharide was shown to induce functional
antibodies. The conjugate of the O1 fragment was recognized by anti-O1
chicken serum. The β-Rha-(1–3)-GlcNAc linkage was successfully
generated by boron mediated insertion of the GlcNAc building block
in the rhamnose-1,2-epoxide intermediate. The assembled structure
was deprotected and conjugated to BSA (40). This conjugate
was shown to recognize chicken anti-O1 serum, using an ELISA assay.

Conjugation of this glycan, using a disuccinimidyl
suberate linker,
to the common carrier protein CRM197 delivered a model
vaccine (33) carrying ±18 oligosaccharides per protein.
Immunization of mice in a mixture with Freund’s complete adjuvant
(FCA), led to the generation of sera with increased IgM, IgG1, IgG2a,
IgG2b, and IgG3 levels. The sera were shown to have bactericidal activity
against the E. coli O157:H7 strain, with 50% killing
at 160-fold dilution.

Recently, Toshima’s group reported
on the synthesis of a
pentasaccharide from the LPS of avian pathogenic E. coli O1, which is considered problematic because of its zoonotic potential.193 The structure (39) presents a
β-ManNAc residue at the upstream end and a β-Rha linked
to the downstream GlcNAc (Figure 9). The synthesis was achieved through a [2+3] strategy,
wherein the β-ManNAc-(1–3)-Rha was built using a Glc
donor, followed by inversion of configuration at the Glc-C2 via an
azide displacement of a triflate intermediate.

Enterococcus faecalis and faecium are Gram-positive bacteria that are
associated with infections worldwide. Enterococci account for 11% of nosocomial bloodstream isolates,
and an increasing trend has been recorded over the last decades.194,195 In the US about 66,000 enterococcal infections occur each year,
of which 20,000 are due to multiple drug-resistant strains, with about
1,300 deaths per year.196

E. faecalis is particularly worrisome because of vancomycin
resistance, which also occurs in the community, with risk factors
including non-heme residence, chronic skin ulcers, previous invasive
procedures, exposure to antibiotics, and the presence of indwelling
devices.197 Four different serotypes (CPS-A
to CPS-D) have been described for E. faecalis by
mapping their immunoreactivities with ELISA and the opsonophagocytic
capacity of antisera raised against the different CPS of prototype
strains combined with analysis of their CPS locus.198 One of the capsules produced by the CPS locus is diheteroglycan
(DHG), which is present in CPS-C and CPS-D strains. DHG masks LTA
in the bacteria and prevents opsonization by anti-LTA antibodies.
The structure of DHG from the E. faecalis type 2
strain has been described by Theilacker and co-workers, where the
polysaccharide repeating unit [→6)-β-d-Galf-(1–3)-β-d-Glcp-(1→]
is decorated at C-5 of the Galf residue with an O-acetyl and at C-3
with an R-lactic acid (Figure 10).198,199

Enterococcus
faecalis and faecium synthetic antigens,
including capsular polysaccharides (DHG), as
well as lipoteichoic acids (LTA) and wall teichoic acids (WTA). Glycoconjugates
of synthetic DHG (45 and 46) and LTA (51) fragments elicited antibodies in rabbit, inducing bacterial
opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) in vitro and providing protection from
bacterial colonization in vivo.

Recently, Laverde et al. described the synthesis of a library of
DHG-oligomers up to an 8-mer in length, lacking the O-acetyl and lactic acid residues.200 The
fragments (43 and 44) were built up using
either Galf-Glcp or Glcp-Galf dimers to explore whether the type of frameshift
played an important role in immunogenicity. The assembled library
of DHG-fragments was functionalized with a biotin handle and printed
on a streptavidin glycan array. It was revealed that the longer fragments
were more immunoreactive with the frameshifts having the “non-self”
galactofuranose terminus appearing as better antigens. The octasaccharides
were selected for conjugation, and the two octamer frameshifts were
coupled to BSA through squarate chemistry (45 and 46). Antibodies raised in mice with the two conjugates showed
opsonophagocytic killing activities of E. faecalis type 2 strains and CPS-C and CPS-D strains expressing DHG. In a
mouse sepsis model, it was shown that the raised sera offered protection
in a passive immunization strategy. As the evaluated synthetic fragments
were not decorated with acetyl or lactic acid substituents, the role
of these functional groups remains to be established. The cell wall
of E. faecalis A and B is not protected by a CPS,
and the LTA of these species is thus more exposed. LTA is built up
from a poly(1–3)-glycerol phosphate (GroP) backbone and has
attracted attention for its potential as an universal antigen as it
is shared with other Gram-positive pathogens such as S. aureus.201−203 Initial studies conducted with isolated
LTA from E. faecalis showed that opsonophagocytic
antibodies could be raised against type 1 LTA, and cross-reactivity
was observed against E. faecalis, E. faecium, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis strains.204 Different synthetic approaches
toward well-defined LTA fragments have been developed using both solution
phase205 and solid phase chemistry,206,207 and these have been recently reviewed.203E. faecalis GroP LTA can be decorated with α-d-glucosyl or α-kojibiosyl residues at the C-2 of the
GroP residues. This position can also carry labile d-alanine
esters. Building on contemporary DNA chemistry, Hogendorf et al. assembled
a small library of LTA fragments, out of which (50) was
identified as a potent antigen, able to inhibit the opsonic killing
of antibodies raised against LTA from E. faecalis 12030.208 The BSA conjugates of (50) induced specific IgG antibodies in rabbits, that were
directed to the native LTA. These antibodies showed cross-reactivity
against other types of Gram-positive strains and could be used in
a passive immunization scheme to protect mice in an endocarditis (heart
valve infection) model.

To generate a broader and more diverse
library of TA oligomers
presenting different carbohydrate appendages at different positions
on the TA chain, van der Es et al. developed a second generation automated
solid phase approach using a universal linker system and fluorous-tagging
strategy.209 These TA fragments were used
to create a TA glycan array to characterize the binding specificity
of sera raised against isolated LTA from E. faecalis and the well-defined TA conjugate (51). The arrays
revealed that the serum raised against the native LTA bound various
TA fragments and no specificity for any carbohydrate pattern became
clear. The serum raised against conjugate (51) proved
to be very selective in binding, showing that it is possible to selectively
raise antibodies to recognize specific and well-defined TA epitopes,
which is not possible for TAs isolated from bacterial sources.

The effect of the α-glycosylation has been recently more
thoroughly explored.210 Using an improved
method for the assembly of the glycosylated GroP building block, a
series of glucosylated GroP hexamers was assembled, varying in the
position of the glucose residue. Besides, a series of glucosylated
GroP of the opposite stereochemistry (sn-1-GroP) was generated as
well. Using glycan array binding studies, it was revealed that antibodies
raised against (52) selectively recognized the sequence
to which they were raised with binding decreasing as the glucose moiety
moved down the chain. The GroP hexamers of the opposite stereochemistry
were poorly recognized. The serum raised against the native LTA bound
the opposite stereochemistry GroP better as it better resembles how
LTA is anchored in the bacterial cell wall. A follow-up study elucidated
the interactions of a mAb generated against (52) and
a library of LTA structures through a combination of glycan array,
ELISA, SPR-analyses, and STD-NMR spectroscopy to show that the number
of GroP residues was important for affinity of the mAb and that binding
was indirectly effected by the presence of the glucose residue.211 This study confirmed the importance of the
backbone chirality.

Enterococci also express
different types of WTA,
where several type 2 WTAs have been described for E. faecalis. A WTA from E. faecium strain U0317 was found to
consist of →6)-α-GalNAc-(1–3)-β-d-GalNAc-(1–2)-GroP-(3→ repeating units, and this complex
WTA can shield the LTA from opsonophagocytic antibodies.198,203,212 While the biosynthesis of LTA
includes GroP units consisting of phosphatidyl glycerol having sn-1-glycerol
phosphate stereochemistry, the WTA is generated using cytidine sn-3-glycerol
phosphate. The stereochemistry of the GroP moiety from the WTA was
unambiguously established by van der Es et al.213 through the synthesis of two sets of oligomers using either
an sn-glycerol-1-phosphate or an sn-glycerol-3-phosphate constituent.
From comparison of the NMR spectra of the synthesized fragments and
naturally occurring WTA, the stereochemistry of E. faecium WTA GroP was established to be sn-3-glycerol phosphate.

Zhou
et al. also reported a synthesis of the E. faecium U0317 repeating unit for investigation of a WTA-based vaccine. However,
this report did not describe the stereochemistry of the GroP moiety.
The target structure was synthesized using H-phosphonate chemistry
to insert the phosphodiester bridged linker for conjugation. The trimer
was conjugated with the carrier proteins KLH and HSA (53) using a bifunctional glutaryl ester, and the conjugates could be
used to generate antibodies that were capable of recognizing the sequence
to which they were raised. Binding to naturally sourced WTA or E. faecium was not reported, nor were any opsonic properties
evaluated.214

Streptococcus pyogenes, commonly known as group
A Streptococcus (GAS), is a Gram-positive β-haemoliticum
bacterium that can cause a variety of diseases, varying from minor
illnesses (pharyngitis and cellulitis) to very serious (glomerulonephritis,
necrotizing fasciitis, and rheumatic fever) and deadly diseases (sepsis).215 It, thus, represents a significant threat to
human health.

Currently GAS infections are treated with antibiotic
therapy, but the increased emergence of antibiotic resistance renders
new effective treatment and prevention strategies urgent.216 The GAS cell wall is decorated with a surface
polysaccharide, classified as the Lancefield antigen,217 that consists of trisaccharide repeating units
of [→3)-α-l-Rha-(1–2)-[β-d-GlcNAc-(1–3)]-α-l-Rha-(1→]. This
polysaccharide is a bacterial virulence factor and has been recognized
as a promising target to develop GAS vaccines.218 Its expression is conserved across a variety of bacterial
strains,219 and protective properties of
anti-GAS-PS antibodies have been demonstrated.220 Pinto and co-workers have reported several syntheses of
GAS-PS fragments and their protein conjugates.221−226 To gain insight into the epitope of GAS-PS, oligosaccharides were
used to study interactions with an IgG3 mAb generated against the
natural polysaccharide. It was found that β-d-GlcNAc-(1–3)-[α-l-Rha-(1–2)]-α-l-Rha and an extended surface
were the key components for epitope recognition.227 Homology-based molecular modeling of the Fv region of the
mAb indicated that two pockets could accommodate two GlcNAc residues
on adjacent trisaccharide units, which was further supported with
data from STD-NMR studies.228

Using
naturally sourced CPS in combination with well-defined synthetic
fragments, it was revealed that polyclonal rabbit serum and serum
of children recovered from a GAS infection showed different binding
specificities.229

The human sera
required a hexasaccharide binding motif with at
least two GlcNAc residues for adequate binding, while the rabbit sera
also bound well to shorter fragments. Likely, repeated exposure to
the bacterium led to affinity maturation of the human antibodies and
a much narrower binding specificity. The GAS PS adopts a helical structure
with the backbone polyrhamnose forming a helix placing the GlcNAc
residues on the periphery.230

Based
on these detailed structural and binding studies it was proposed
that an effective oligosaccharide conjugate vaccine would require
the presentation of a contiguous series of GAS-PS helical motifs and
would likely be comprised of, at least, a doubly branched hexasaccharide.
Indeed, when the immunogenicity of TT conjugates of a synthetic hexasaccharide,
conjugated through squarate chemistry (55), and the native
cell-wall polysaccharide (CWPS) were compared in mice, similar IgG
titers were elicited (Figure 11 panel A).231 In a more recent
work by Costantino and co-workers, a series of GAS oligosaccharides
with different frameshifts were chemically synthesized and the immunogenicities
of their CRM197 conjugates were tested in mice.232 All the structures induced robust production
of functional IgGs, and the dodecasaccharide (56) with
a terminal Rha residue induced the highest opsonophagocytic titer.
A similar trend was observed in a GAS infection model, indicating
the correlation of opsonic antibodies with protection. Gu and co-workers
have tested synthetic GAS-PS with different carrier proteins, including
BSA, CRM197, TT, and GAS C5a peptidase (ScpA, 57).233 The use of a streptococcal protein
could increase protection and could avoid potential epitope suppression
with CRM197,234 as this latter
protein is used in many commercial vaccines. Mono-, di-, and trimers
of the trisaccharide repeating unit of GAS PS were synthesized by
a convergent and efficient strategy and conjugated to an enzymatically
inactive ScpA mutant through a bifunctional glutaryl linker.233 The ScpA-neoglycoconjugate induced an anti-carbohydrate
immune response in mice, that was comparable to the one elicited by
the related CRM197 and TT conjugates. In addition, robust
ScpA193-specific antibodies were observed, making the ScpA193–oligosaccharide
conjugates promising bivalent anti-GAS vaccine candidates.

Synthetic
strategies for group A Streptococcus antigens and
collected immune data. (A) Immunization with a GAS
cell wall hexasaccharide conjugated to BSA through squarate chemistry
induced antibodies identical to a natural CPS-TT conjugate. In silico
conformational analysis of the immunogenic fragment suggested that
the polyrhamnose backbone forms a helix with the GlcNAc moieties on
the periphery. Adapted with permission from ref (230). Copyright 2004 Elsevier).
(B) The GAS dodecasaccharide conjugated to CRM197 elicited
a high titer of anti-GAS opsonic antibodies. (C) Chemoenzymatically
assembled nonasaccharide conjugated to the GAS protein ScpA (GAS C5a
peptidase) induced antibodies against both antigens. (D) Site-selective
conjugation of natural GAS polysaccharide to the streptococcal protein
SpyAD induced antibodies able to provide in vivo protection in mice.
(E) GAS trisaccharide conjugated to a synthetic peptidolipid, containing
the T-cell peptide epitope PADRE.

In another study a more in-depth immunological characterization
of the ScpA193 conjugates was conducted. Of the tri-, hexa-, and nonasaccharides,
the latter two nonasaccharide–ScpA193 conjugates in a mouse
model revealed that the latter conjugate could effectively protect
structures, leading to a better in vitro recognition of GAS cells
and opsonophagocytosis.235

Evaluation
of the hexasaccharides and the animals from GAS challenge
and GAS-induced pulmonary damage showed significantly increased animal
survival. Further studies suggested that the two ScpA193 conjugates
could function through activation of CD4+ T-cells and promotion of
T-cell help, which would trigger differentiation into antigen-specific
Th1 and Th2 cells, which, in turn, would provoke strong B-cell activation
and IgG production.

It has been proposed that antibodies directed
at the immunodominant
GlcNAc residues may give rise to autoimmunity directed at GlcNAc residues
on self-tissue. Therefore, polyrhamnose has been proposed as a possible
alternative to GAS PS,236,237 and it has been shown
that an immune response can be invoked against the polyrhamnose backbone,
lacking the GlcNAc branches, and that sera raised against this backbone
PS can promote opsonophagocytic killing of multiple GAS strains to
offer protection against a systemic GAS challenge after passive immunization.236 Nanoparticles generated by conjugation of a
rhamnohexaose, corresponding to three consecutive GAS PS epitopes,
devoid of the GlcNAc moieties, to gold beads have been shown to inhibit
binding of anti-GAS murine serum in an ELISA setup, indicating that
this hexasaccharide may be an adequate antigen in a synthetic anti-GAS
vaccine.238 Naturally sourced GAS-polyrhamnose
has been conjugated to the streptococcal protein SpyAD (58) and explored as a vaccine modality.239 Conjugation was achieved in a site-selective fashion by expressing
the protein in the so-called Xpress cell-free expression system, to
incorporate a non-natural amino acid enabling click chemistry of the
polysaccharides. The conjugated SpyAD-GACPR elicited antibodies that
bound the surface of various GAS strains and promoted opsonophagocytic
killing by human neutrophils. Active immunization of mice with a multivalent
vaccine consisting of SpyAD-polyrhamnose, together with the candidate
vaccine antigens streptolysin O and C5a peptidase, protected against
a GAS challenge in a systemic infection model and localized skin infection
model. No evidence for cross-reactivity to human heart or brain tissue
epitopes was found, indicating this approach can circumvent potential
safety concerns of the GlcNAc carrying GAS PS. Furthermore, the inactive
mutant of SpyAD is suited for site-selective conjugation, thereby
preserving critical protective immune epitopes of the carrier protein.

An innovative design has been proposed by Stephenson and co-workers,
who conjugated small GAS PS fragments to a synthetic peptidolipid,
containing the PADRE peptide, known to trigger T-cell responses.240 By this approach a fully synthetic nanoparticle
vaccine (59) of 300–500 nm was formulated. The
di- and trirhamnosyl as well as the GlcNAc dirhamnosyl lipopeptides
were able to produce statistically significant GAC-specific IgG responses
in comparison to unconjugated structures.241 Mice were immunized with the glycopeptidolipids, and the serum raised
against the di- and trirhamnoside constructs showed opsonic activity.

Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a Gram-positive pathogen that colonizes
the recto-vaginal tract and represents a major cause of neonatal and
maternal infections.242 There is an estimate
of 2.6 million stillbirths each year, many of which are due to GBS
infections, especially in low and middle income contexts.243 The bacterial capsule is surrounded by sialylated
branched polysaccharides, which share great structural similarity
to one another, based on which 10 serotypes are defined (Ia, Ib, II,
III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX).

All GBS polysaccharides
are sialylated, and most of them share the same monosaccharide residues.244,245 The GBS CPS is a fundamental virulence factor and is promising for
the development of a vaccine for maternal immunization,242 in which the vaccine would be administered
to pregnant women to elicit serum antibodies that are then transferred
to the baby through the placenta. Data on the global distribution
of GBS clinical isolates show that a hexavalent vaccine including
serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V could provide a protection over
95% for all virulent GBS strains, and multicomponent CRM197 conjugates have been tested in phase I and II clinical trials.246,247 Vaccines currently under development exploit polysaccharides extracted
from bacteria conjugated to CRM197, which yield complex
heterogeneous mixtures.

Synthetic GBS oligosaccharides have
been prepared and evaluated
at a preclinical level, being mainly used to understand the chemical
features correlating with immunogenicity. Among all GBS serotypes,
type III has been most studied, because of its seroprevalence.243

Various approaches to produce short PSIII
fragments have been based
on either depolymerization or approaches employing organic synthesis
or chemoenzymatic tools.243 GBS type III
PS has for a long time been regarded to be a length-dependent conformational
epitope. Molecular dynamics simulations and NMR studies248,249 showed that the GBS PSIII is able to form extended helical structures
formed of at least four repeating units (RUs), that are stabilized
by the presence of the charged sialic acids.47

This hypothesis has been based on the length-dependent recognition
of the PS polymer with a high affinity anti-PSIII mAb. The presumed
conformational epitope has hampered the development of anti PSIII
vaccines based on short synthetic glycans, which have only recently
emerged as useful tools to effectively mimic the GBS PSIII in its
immunogenicity.

Syntheses of structures related to the linear
form of the GBSIII
repeating unit, a glycan that has also been found as part of viral
glycans, have been reported;99,250 however, these linear
structures have been found to be poorly immunogenic. The synthesis
of GBS structures poses several challenges, one of which is the α-sialylation
of the Gal residues. Significant advances have been made to achieve
stereoselective sialylations with the development of new building
blocks and glycosylation methodologies, summarized in Table 3.251

Table 3: Synthetic GBS Structures and Corresponding
Synthetic Strategies

An early synthesis of a
more complex branched GBSIII oligosaccharide
was based on a chemoenzymatic approach where a tetrasaccharide fragment252 was sialylated using a specific rat liver sialyltransferase
to obtain the branched repeating unit (60).

A completely
chemical assembly of a PSIII heptasaccharide (61) using
a highly convergent strategy has been described
by Demchenko and Boons,253 who used a highly
convergent strategy which also provided the hexasaccharide fragment
without the sialic acid.254 Zou et al.
used a chemoenzymatic approach to assemble the decasaccharide, representing
two repeating units of GBSIII.255

The octasaccharide precursor was enzymatically sialylated by reaction
with an α-(2–3)-sialyltransferase and CMP-Neu5Ac as donor.
Using the same octasaccharide, an N-propionyl substituted
sialic acid analog of the GBSIII dimer was also prepared. A similar
enzymatic approach has been utilized to transform oligosaccharides
from pneumococcal ST14 to their PSIII counterparts.256 More recently, a thorough study on the immunogenicity of
the three different repeating unit frameshifts has been conducted
by Adamo and co-workers.257 A branched
(66) and “Y-shaped” (67) pentasaccharide,
along with the linear frameshift (65), bearing a linker
for conjugation to carrier proteins were generated through a convergent
[3+2] approach employing a sialogalactosyl imidate donor.

The
pentasaccharides were coupled to CRM197 and the
conjugates bound to polyclonal antibodies in anti-PSIII murine serum
in an ELISA. The branching β-(1–6) glucose, linked to
the GlcNAc residue, proved to be an important motif for antibody recognition.
Next, structural studies, including STD-NMR and X-ray experiments,
indicated that a hexasaccharide fragment spanning across two repeating
units is responsible for interactions with a protective mAb.258

It was found that oligosaccharides, obtained
from nitrosylation
of the polymer, with a length between 2 and 6 repeating units and
conjugated to CRM197, were able to elicit a functional
immune response, comparable to CRM197-PSIII, when conjugated
with high glycodensity.259 Following these
studies, the synthetic hexasaccharide (76) corresponding
to the identified minimal structural epitope was synthesized using
a regioselective glycosylation approach (Figure 12), and this structure was conjugated to
CRM197 for in vivo evaluation. The resulting neoglycoconjugate
elicited a strong protective immune response, similar the GBSIII conjugate
that is currently in clinical trials, confirming that the hexasaccharide
is the minimal GBS serotype III epitope and indicating the potential
of the synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccine targeting these complex
polysaccharides.260

(A) X-ray crystallography
of semisynthetic GBS III-DP2 (76) complexed with an anti
PSIII rabbit Fab. (B) Combining data from
STD-NMR and X-ray crystallography led to the identification of GBSIII
structural minimal epitope highlighted in blue corresponding to hexasaccharide
(76), which was synthesized accordingly. (C) The hexasaccharide
(76) was conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein
through the SIDEA activation chemistry and tested in mice. (D) Hexa-CRM197 conjugate elicited functional antibodies comparable to
the positive control PSIII-CRM197.

Over the years, various syntheses of other GBS serotype glycans
have been reported, with a focus on serotype Ia, which—after
type III—is one of the most prevalent serotypes. The GBSIa
hexasaccharide (68) was prepared using a chemoenzymatic
synthesis starting from a synthetic pentasaccharide, using an enzymatic
sialylation.261

In 2015 a total chemical
synthesis of the pentasaccharide corresponding
to the branched repeating unit of GBSIa (69) was accomplished
using a convergent [2+3] route using a sialogalactosyl thioglycoside
donor and a branched trisaccharide acceptor.262 An investigation on the reactivity of the galactose acceptor in
the glycosylation reaction showed that the presence of a sugar at
the 4-O-position had a big impact on the reactivity of the C-3-hydroxy
group, since it made the 3-O position inaccessible for further glycosylation.

Glycosylating the 3-O-position had a smaller impact
on the 4-O-position, and for this reason the most
effective sequence to glycosylate the galactose C-3 and C-4 hydroxy
groups was to glycosylate the 3-O-position before
introduction of a glycan to the C-4-OH. This approach was extended
to the synthesis of a GBSIa decasaccharide (70), corresponding
to two repeating units, which was prepared using a highly convergent
strategy. First, a key intermediate trisaccharide was constructed
via a one-pot iterative glycosylation; then, it was elongated to provide
the hexasaccharide intermediate to which two side chains were attached
by dual glycosylation with a sialogalactoside donor.264

Both the GBS Ia monomer and dimer were conjugated
to CRM197, and the resulting glycoconjugates were evaluated
in mice, showing
that both conjugates induced robust IgM and IgG antibodies, which
were cross-reactive with both the monomeric and dimeric haptens, offering
the first proof of principle for the use of synthetic glycans for
an anti GBS Ia vaccine. Another convergent synthesis of branched GBS
Ia and Ib repeating units ((71) and (72),
respectively) has recently been described by our group, along with
their linear frameshifts. NMR studies of these structures in combination
with molecular dynamic simulations on the PSIa and PSIb polysaccharides
were used to explain the origin of the highly specific immune response
against these structurally very similar PSs, which differ only in
one linkage in the repeating unit.

These conformational studies
indicated that they place the disaccharide
Neu5Ac(2–3)Gal motifs in a different spatial orientation, leading
to the presentation of different epitopes.265 Other GBS serotypes have also been synthesized, but data on their
immunogenicity are not yet available. Gao et al. described the first
synthesis of a GBS type V repeating unit, consisting of a heptasaccharide
fragment.

The target structure (73) was prepared
using a preactivation-based
one-pot [2+1+4] glycosylation strategy, which not only resulted in
the reduction of the number of steps to the final oligosaccharide
but also minimized manipulations of the glycosyl donor.267 A GBS type II branched heptasaccharide (74), corresponding to a frameshift of the repeating unit,
was prepared by a convergent [4+2+1] glycosylation strategy.266 Recently, Guo and co-workers also assembled
a hexasaccharide repeating unit of GBS type VII and the corresponding
dimer (75). The synthesis was achieved by means of a
preactivation-based iterative one-pot glycosylation protocol, which
was made possible by optimization of the challenging stereoselective
α-glucosylation reaction.263

These synthetic efforts will pave the way for the preparation of
even more complex GBS oligosaccharides from different serotypes. These
structurally well-defined oligosaccharides can be used to map the
relevant epitopes expressed by the capsular polysaccharides and be
used as potential antigens in GBS glycoconjugate vaccines.

K. pneumoniae (Kp) is a commensal Gram-negative
bacterium that can cause chronic urinary tract and soft tissue infections,
pneumonia, and sepsis, particularly in elderly and immunocompromised
subjects.197,268,269Klebsiella spp. are the third most frequent cause
of healthcare-associated infections, and the occurrence of multidrug-resistant
Kp strains is considered as an urgent threat worldwide.269 Carbapenem-resistant (CR-Kp) and extended spectrum
β-lactamase (ESBL-Kp) Kp are major causes of concern due to
the lack of therapeutic options; therefore, prevention of Kp infections
by vaccination has become of paramount importance.270 Synthetic vaccines targeting the sugar armory of Kp are
currently under preclinical development. Kp surface oligosaccharide
molecules, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS, K-antigen), and the lipopolysaccharide
(LPS, with the O-antigen as the main target) are major virulence factors
and promising targets for the development of vaccines.271

The CPS is mainly involved in colonization,
adhesion, perpetuation, and proliferation in the host, while the LPS
plays a main role in conferring resistance to the bactericidal activity
of the complement.272

Kp K-antigen
is anchored to the outer membrane through a lipid
A tail. The structural variability of the CPS is extremely high, with
more than 77 serotypes identified. This heterogeneity challenges the
development of vaccines based on the CPS, which should comprise at
least 24 serotypes to ensure adequate coverage against the most virulent
strains. Proof of concept of the use of the K-antigen as a vaccine
target has been provided in late ’80s and ’90s, when
a six-valent and a 24-valent vaccine based on different Kp CPS were
tested in humans, showing it to be safe and to induce serospecific
IgGs in all vaccines.273 Due to the complexity
in manufacturing these vaccines, the development was discontinued.
It did, however, provide the proof of principle for the use of K-antigens
in anti-Kp vaccines. Besides the use of full-length, high molecular
weight extracted polysaccharides, in 1985 Zigterman et al. demonstrated
the efficacy of a vaccine based on an octasaccharide, obtained by
depolymerization of the Kp capsular polysaccharide serotype 11.274 K1 and K2 are the most virulent Kp serotypes,
often present in antibiotic resistance strains, and these have, therefore,
been recently targeted for vaccine design through different technologies.
In 2019, expression of K1 and K2 polysaccharides conjugated to EPA
was achieved in E. coli, and the bioconjugates proved
to be immunogenic in mice and provided protection from lethal infections
by two hypervirulent Kp strains.275 Recently,
the synthesis of oligosaccharides derived from K2 CPS was described
and the obtained oligosaccharides were used as tools to elucidate
the structure of the minimal epitope.276 The repeating unit of the K2 antigen is built up from a [→3)-β-d-Glc-(1–4)-β-d-Man-(1–4)-α-d-Glc-(1→] backbone carrying α-d-GlcpA
branches at the O3 of the mannoses. The main challenge of the synthesis
is presented by the two 1,2-cis linkages (Figure 13A). First, the
tetrasaccharide repeating unit was assembled; then, it was elongated
through [1+4], [2+4], [3+4], and [4+4] glycosylations to obtain the
penta-, the hexa-, the hepta-, and the octasaccharides. The α-selective
glycosylation, key for the elongation process, was achieved using
glycosyl fluoride donors using Cp2HfCl2/AgOTf
mediated catalysis. The synthetic hexa-, hepta-, and octasaccharides
(81) were conjugated to DT and tested in mice. Sera against
the heptasaccharide were able to cross-react with all synthetic glycans,
including the longer octasaccharide (81), and antisera
against the hepta- and the octasaccharide DT conjugates showed a high
titer of functional antibodies in a serum bactericidal assay.

Synthetic
routes for K. pneumoniae glycans for
immunological testing: (A) Design of conjugates from synthetic fragments
of the K2 capsule used for immunization of rabbits. (B) Conjugates
from Kp ST238 CPS, that have been tested in rabbits, providing antibodies
with opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) activity in vitro. (C) Structures
related to O1 and O2 O-antigens used in the glycan array.

A synthetic approach to the repeating unit of Kp ST238 CPS,
a carbapenem-resistant
(CR) strain which has been responsible for several outbreaks in hospitals
in the US,277 has been described by Seeberger’s
team.278 The target hexasaccharide was
synthesized using a [3+3] convergent approach based on three monosaccharide
building blocks, of which the GalA building block was obtained by
a de novo route (Figure 13B). The synthetic hexasaccharide (86) and shorter
fragments were anchored to a glycan array and assayed against the
protective mouse IgM mAb 1C9, raised against the CR-Kp CPS. The specific
recognition of the hexasaccharide was demonstrated by inhibition of
the binding of the mAb preincubated with Kp CPS. The hexasaccharide
was then conjugated to the carrier protein CRM197 and tested
in mice in two adjuvanted formulations, one with the Freund adjuvant
(FA) and the other with Alum, which both elicited antibodies reactive
against the hexasaccharide. However, only the conjugate formulated
with FA induced antibodies that were cross-reactive with the Kp CPS.
The formulation with Alum was also tested in rabbits and induced antibodies
that were able to bind Kp cells and promoted the uptake and killing
by phagocytic cells, indicating that the hexasaccharide-CRM197 conjugate represents a promising vaccine against hypervirulent CR-Kp.
Two mAbs, 17H12 and 8F12, binding the synthetic glycan epitope, were
shown to agglutinate all clade 2 strains and were also shown to promote
inhibition of biofilm formation and extracellular killing of these
bacteria, by complement deposition and the deployment of neutrophil
extracellular traps.279 The mAbs also promoted
opsonophagocytic and intracellular killing of Kp by human derived
neutrophils and cultured murine macrophages, indicating that this
structure can be targeted to develop therapeutics.

The Kp LPS
is composed of a conserved core oligosaccharide linked
to the terminal lipid A portion and to the O-antigen, whose composition
is highly variable across different strains. As opposed to the K-antigens,
only 11 O-antigens have been identified, and these have been used
for Kp typing; four of these O-antigens (O1, O2, O3, and O5) are found
in clinically relevant strains, and therefore, it has been proposed
that a vaccine comprising these four serotypes would ensure a 80%
coverage against Kp infections.280 O1 and
O2 consist of d-galactose and d-galactofuranose,
while O3 (including the related serotype O3b) and O5 are composed
of d-mannoses. The O1 polysaccharide is the most prevalent
serotype in clinical isolates, followed by the O2 and the O3 polysaccharides;
therefore, most preclinical development of potential vaccines focused
on these serotypes.

The O1-antigen is built of two polysaccharide
types: Galactan (Gal)
I, located at the inner part of the O-chain, shared also with other
Kp serotypes (O2 and O2ac) and formed by a [→3)-Galp-β-(1–3)-Galf-α-(1→]
repeating unit, and Galactan II, constituting the capping sequences
and formed by a [→3)-Galp-β-(1–3)-Galp-α-(1→] repeating unit.281 Extracted O-antigens have been tested in animal models
as stand-alone polysaccharide antigen282 or conjugated to Tetanus Toxoid283 and P. aeruginosa flagellins FlaA and FlaB.284 The syntheses of O-antigens belonging to serotypes O1 and
O2 have been described. The first synthesis of the Galactan I disaccharide
β-Galf-(1–3)-Galp,
corresponding to the repeating unit of O2 LPS, was reported by Wang
et al.427 Longer Gal I oligosaccharides
(a tetra- and hexasaccharide), bearing a p-methoxyphenyl
aglycone at the reducing end, were prepared by Zhu et al.285 The synthetic design was based on the preparation
of a Galf-β-(1–3)-Galp disaccharide intermediate bearing a p-methoxyphenyl
group at the reducing end and a levulinoyl group to mask the Galf
3-OH. The key step in the synthesis was the α-selective galactopyranosylation
of the 3-OH of the di- and tetrasaccharide acceptor in solvent controlled
glycosylation reactions. Further advances in the synthesis of Gal
I (90) and II (91) hexasaccharide fragments
were reported by Nifantiev and co-workers (Figure 13C).286,287 A [2+2+2] synthetic
approach was developed, and a pyranoside-into-furanoside (PIF) rearrangement
was used to generate the galactofuranose building block. The synthesized
di-, tetra-, and hexasaccharides of both serotypes were biotinylated
for immobilization on a streptavidin-coated glycan array plate to
screen sera against Kp O1 of serotypes K1, K2, and K16. All tested
sera showed significant concentration-dependent reactivity with the
Gal II hexasaccharide while less interaction was observed with the
Gal II tetrasaccharide and the disaccharide was poorly recognized.
The Gal I tetra- and hexasaccharides were specifically recognized
by antibodies in sera against the Kp type 16, but not types 1 and
2, showing domination of Gal II antibodies over anti Gal I antibodies.

O1 and O2 oligosaccharides (and related subtypes O2afg and O2ac)
with a length ranging from one to eight repeating units were synthesized
recently using a highly convergent strategy based on a key di-galactose
building block with a 3-Nap protecting group. Oligosaccharides from
these serotypes were conjugated to CRM197 and tested in
vivo in rabbit and mice. After immunization, functional antibodies
against the homologous oligosaccharides used for the immunization
and against the natural O-polysaccharides of Kp serotypes O1, O2,
and O2ac and carbapenem-resistant ST258 were detected, indicating
the potential of these vaccines to confer protection against Kp infections.288

O3, O3b, and O5 polysaccharides represent
other clinically relevant
Kp O-antigen serotypes which should be included in a vaccine to ensure
adequate coverage against circulating strains. The repeating units
of these polysaccharides are composed of mannoses and vary in the
length of the repeating unit and the linkages between the monosaccharides.
Syntheses of oligosaccharides from O3 to O3b to O5 have been recently
described both in solution phase and by automated glycan assembly
on a polymer matrix. O3 oligosaccharides spanning from one to four
RUs (from pentamer to 20-mer), O3b hexa- and dodecasaccharides (corresponding
to two and four RUs), and O5 tri-, hexa-, and nonasaccharides (one,
two, and three RUs) were assembled and equipped with a chemical handle
suitable for conjugation. Key building blocks for the solid phase
synthesis were the two mannoses reported in bearing temporary protections
on 2-OH and/or 3-OH, giving access to all the target O-antigen structures.
The O3 pentasaccharide and O5 hexasaccharide were activated as p-nitrophenyl esters and conjugated to CRM197 and BSA. The CRM197-conjugates were formulated with Alum
for mice immunization and incomplete Freund adjuvant for rabbit immunization.
Sera from immunized rabbits cross-reacted in ELISA with the corresponding
O-antigens as BSA conjugates, while sera from mice were able to selectively
recognize the homologous LPS.288

N. gonorrhoeae is a Gram-negative diplococcus bacterium
closely related to other human Neisseria spp. N. gonorrhoeae only infects humans and most commonly leads
to urethritis in men and cervicitis in women.289 It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection
gonorrhea and other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated
gonococcemia, septic arthritis, and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.
Among these, the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhea remains
a major global public health concern, causing 87 million cases globally
and being the second most commonly reported infection in the United
States.290 To date, there is no vaccine
for gonorrhea in humans, and efforts to develop it are becoming increasingly
important, given the growing threat of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) and increased incidence of STI gonorrhea. Recent studies have
shown that vaccines against a closely related pathogen, such as the N. meningitidis serogroup B vaccine Bexsero, containing
outer membrane vesicle (OMV) components can reduce the incidence of
gonorrhea.291 Several approaches for the
identification of a candidate vaccine from outer membrane or pilin
proteins are currently in preclinical development.292

N. gonorrhoeae lipooligosaccharides
(LOS) play a major role in pathogenesis by inducing host inflammatory
responses, including resistance to complement, adhesion, and entry
into cells, and also enabling evasion of host innate immunity through
sialylation.293 The LOS is located in the
outer membrane of the pathogen and constitutes about 50% of its mass.
LOS are composed of three oligosaccharide (OS) chains, made up of
glucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine, which
are linked to two heptose residues, which in turn are attached to
lipid A through two molecules of 2-keto-3-deoxy-mannooctulosonic acid
(Kdo) (Figure 14).

Chemical
structure of N. gonorroheae LOS, composed
of three characteristic α, β and γ chains. Highlighted
is the epitope identified through the C27 mAb.

One OS chain, the α-chain, extends from the first heptose
(Hep-I), while the second and third chains, the β- and γ-chains,
are attached to the second heptose (Hep-II) (Figure 14). The compositions of the oligosaccharides
are highly variable, in length, carbohydrate content, and number of
chains. Phosphoethanolamines, acetyl esters, glycines, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and Kdo can also be present, resulting in
heterogeneity of the LOS and different antigenic epitopes.294,295

In the last decade the so-called peptide mimotope approach
has
been applied to resemble the carbohydrate epitope structure, recognized
by the opsonophagocytic mAb 2C7.296 By
screening a random peptide library, the Octa-MAP1 peptide was identified
as an immunological surrogate of the 2C7-oligosaccharide epitope.
The 2C7 epitope mainly includes the α-lactoside on Hep and may
also contain a β-lactoside on Hep-I. In vivo evaluation of the
Octa-MAP1 peptide in a mouse model demonstrated that it is capable
of generating cross-reactive anti-LOS antibodies with complement-dependent
bactericidal activity against gonococci.294

P. aeruginosa (PA) is a ubiquitous, Gram-negative
bacterium that can grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
Serious infections with PA are primarily encountered in the hospital
setting,297 such as fulminant and acute
ventilator-associated pneumonia.298,299 PA causes
slowly progressive deterioration of pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis
(CF) patients297 as well as non-CF bronchiectasis
in COPD patients.300,301 Antibiotic resistance of PA
is a major concern, and consequently, attempts have been made to obtain
a vaccine, amongst others targeting the OAg. There are 20 different
OAg structures, of which about 11 are expressed in the majority of
PA clinical isolates.

The most commonly isolated serotypes in
acute infection are O1, 6, and 11, although there are also isolates
lacking the OAg.302 A challenge associated
with the OAg is the structural variability of the lipid A in the transition
from acute to chronic infections, when the LPS changes from smooth
(with OAg) to rough (without OAg). An eight-valent vaccine consisting
of OAgs conjugated to exotoxin A (EPA), Aerugen, was initially demonstrated
to be safe and immunogenic in plasma donors, as well as bone marrow
transplant and noncolonized CF patients.303−306 In a larger trial in European CF patients, however, Aerugen showed
good safety but no significant difference in clinical outcome compared
to the placebo control group.307 In bronchiectasis
patients, eliciting high titers of IgG2, specific against the OAg,
resulted in impaired serum mediated PA killing,308 which could explain the inconsistent results of LPS-based
vaccination approaches.

Synthesis of fragments lacking Lipid
A contaminants could be a
means to better understand the reasons behind this inconsistent data.
PA expresses two distinct lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules, also
known as the A-band and B-band.309 The
B-band is the serospecific LPS, while the A-band is the common LPS
antigen composed of a d-rhamnose O-polysaccharide chain.
Ghosh’s group constructed synthetic routes toward the trisaccharide
repeating unit [→2)-α-d-Rha-(1–3)-α-d-Rha-(1–3)-α-d-Rha-(1→] of the
A-band polysaccharide.310 The total synthesis
of the PA 1244 pilin trisaccharide α-5N-βOHC4-7N-FmPse-(2–4)-β-Xyl-(1–3)-FucNAc
was achieved by Liu311 and co-workers.
Kulkarni and co-workers have accomplished the challenging synthesis
of the PA O11 trisaccharide β-d-Glc-(1–3)-α-l-FucNAc-(1–3)-β-d-FucNAc,312 where the highly stereoselective 1,2-cis incorporation of the l-fucosamine and d-fucosamine residues was achieved using fucosazide thioglycosyl building
blocks.

PA also expresses exopolysaccharides, such as Psl, which
is found
in 76% of all analyzed clinical isolates. Its expression occurs in
the primary infecting strains but seems to play a role also in establishing
a persistent infection.313−315 Psl is responsible for the formation
and maintenance of biofilms, and an anti-Psl monoclonal antibody exhibited
opsonophagocytic killing of a number of strains and conferred significant
protection in multiple animal models.

Boons and co-workers reported
the synthesis of a Psl tetra-, penta-,
hexa-, and decasaccharide316 (Figure 15) to map the epitope
of three different classes of mAbs, developed as therapeutics to treat
PA infections.317 The synthetic strategy
enabled the efficient stereoselective installation of the challenging
β-mannosyl linkages as well as the construction of the very
crowded mannoside that is glycosylated at C-1, C-2, and C-3.316 The class II mAb reacted potently with each
oligosaccharide, indicating its epitope to reside within the tetrasaccharide,
indicating no need for a branched mannoside. The class III antibody
well recognized the hexasaccharide and weakly interacted with the
decasaccharide, while no binding was observed with the tetra- or pentasaccharide,
suggesting a terminal glucoside as a requirement for mAb recognition.
Finally, the class I mAb did not react with any of the oligosaccharides,
suggesting that some missing structural feature is needed for binding.

Synthetic
strategy for P. aeruginosa Psl oligosaccharides
and immune evaluation with class I, II, and II mAbs. Of these three
mAbs, while class II and III allowed epitope mapping, class I did
not map any epitope, suggesting that the structure is lacking motifs
relevant for antibody recognition.

Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative bacterium
that is most widespread in developing countries, and it is responsible
for severe gastroenteritis and systemic illnesses.318

Human infections are generally due to the ingestion
of contaminated food or water and can generally be attributed to four
key serovars: S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi
(Typhoidal Salmonellae), the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid
fever, and S. Typhymurium and S.
Enteritidis (non-typhoidal Salmonellae, NTS), responsible for gastroenteritis
and bloodstream infections.319,320 Conventionally, Salmonella infections are treated with antibiotics, but
the rise of multidrug-resistant strains demands the development of
effective vaccines.321

The Vi capsular
polysaccharide (Vi PS) is the most important virulence
factor of S. Typhi, making it the principal target
of vaccines. A Vi polysaccharide-based vaccine322 and an oral typhoid vaccine, Ty21a,323 consisting of an attenuated strain of S. Typhi, have been available for many years, but they are poorly
immunogenic in young children, where the burden of invasive salmonella
disease is highest.319 More recently, a
conjugate vaccine against typhoid fever caused by S. typhi has been licensed in India.318 A variety of glycoconjugate Vi vaccines differing
in the carrier protein (TT, DT, CRM197, and EPA) have been
developed and have been tested at different clinical stages.324 The Vi PS is a linear homopolymer of [→4)-α-d-GalNAcA-1→], predominantly O-acetylated at C3-OH3,325 and the synthesis
of Vi oligomers is challenging because of the presence of the 1,2-cis glycosidic linkages.326 Yang
et al. reported an effective synthesis involving the use of a carbamate
protecting group masking the C-2-NH2 and C-3-OH, that allows
for stereoselective glycosylation reactions and easy removal.326 This protective group was used in syntheses
of both acceptor (100) and donor (101) di-,
tri-, and tetrasaccharides bearing an extra acetyl group in the C4-OH
position of the terminal repeating unit (Figure 16A). It has been shown that short oligosaccharides
having an acetyl group are considerably more immunogenic than the
methylated analogs previously reported in the literature,327 suggesting that the OAc groups are an important
antigenic determinant.328 In a subsequent
study, the authors used the same approach to extend the oligosaccharide
chain of the Vi antigen. Penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and octasaccharides
were synthesized, and a competitive ELISA showed that the hexasaccharide
could represent the minimal epitope of the Vi antigen.329 Despite numerous efforts to develop typhoid
vaccines, there are no approved products against the other serotypes.330,331

Synthetic approaches for conjugates from Salmonella oligosaccharides: (A) Fragments of S. Typhi capsular
polysaccharide used to identify the minimal epitope length. (B) Design
of conjugates against S. Enteritidis and Paratyphi
and immunological evaluation in animal models.

Over the years, studies have been performed to identify protective
antigens and evaluate the best strategy to develop an efficient vaccine. S. Paratyphi, as well as S. Enteritidis
and S. Typhimurium, does not express the Vi antigen,
leaving the cell surface-exposed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a promising
vaccine target. The OAg portion of LPS is responsible for Salmonella serovar specificity and is considered to be an
excellent protective antigen.332 The OAg
moiety of S. Paratyphi A that is composed of [→2)-α-d-Man-(1–4)-α-l-Rha-(1–3)-α-d-Gal-(1→] repeats with an α-d-paratose
branch at the mannose C3 was proven to be immunogenic in mice (Figure 15B).333 Acetylation of the rhamnose C-3-OH is known
to be an important factor for antigenicity.334 The first synthesis of a tetrasaccharide representing the S. Paratyphi A repeating unit (105) has recently
been achieved following a stereoselective [2+2] glycosylation strategy.335 After conjugation to the bacteriophage Qβ-carrier
(106), its immunogenicity was tested in mice and rabbits,
highlighting the importance of the paratose residue and O-acetyl modifications on the backbone for antibody recognition. It
was demonstrated that one repeating unit is sufficient to elicit protective
antibodies, suggesting a promising direction for the development of
synthetic antigen-based Salmonella vaccines.335 Vaccines are under development against other Salmonella species, and a bivalent S. Typhimurium
and S. Enteritidis vaccine formulation based on vesicle-based
technology that involves the use of generalized modules for membrane
antigens (GMMA), naturally expressing the OAg, has shown promising
results in mice.336

The S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium
OAg share the same trisaccharide backbone of S. Paratyphi
but differ in the structure of the mannose C-3 side chains, in glucosylation,
and in O-acetylation. S. Enteritidis
presents two oligosaccharides corresponding to two representations
of the repeating unit →3)-α-d-Galp-(1–2)-[α-d-Tyv-(1–3)]-α-d-Man-(1–4)-α-l-Rha-(1→ and α-d-Tyv-(1–3)-α-d-Man-(1–4)-α-l-Rha-(1–3)-α-d-Gal-(1→.337 Both structures
present a rare tyvelose monosaccharide which was shown to play an
important role in pathogenesis.338 The
first synthesis of the α-d-Gal-(1–2)-[α-d-Tyv-(1–3)]-α-d-Man-(1–4)-α-l-Rha tetrasaccharide repeating unit was achieved by using a
key dodecylthioglycosyl donor.339 Recently,
Huang’s group reported the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide
frameshift α-d-Tyv-(1–3)-α-d-Man-(1–4)-α-l-Rhap-(1–3)-α-d-Gal (107) following a [2+2] glycosylation strategy. The tetrasaccharide conjugated
to Qβ (108) proved to be immunogenic in mice and
rabbits, suggesting that one repeating unit is sufficient to produce
anti-OPS antibodies.340 A synthetic approach
was also reported for a methyl 3-O-(3,6-dideoxy-α-d-xylopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside
disaccharide from S. Typhimurium, which upon conjugation
was immunogenic in rabbits.341 Subsequently,
this synthetic disaccharide and tetra-, octa-, and dodecasaccharides,
corresponding to one, two, and three repeating units, respectively,
generated by fragmentation of S. Typhimurium OPS,
were conjugated to BSA to evaluate the influence of glycan size on
antibody response in rabbits and mice.342,343 It was proposed
that an optimal S. Typhimurium antigen should be
composed of an octa- or dodecasaccharide and that the conjugate vaccine
carries approximately 20 saccharide molecules per protein molecule.343

S. aureus is a commensal
Gram-positive bacterium
and one of the most important hospital pathogens. Multidrug-resistant
strains pose a significant health threat, and S. aureus invasion can lead to toxic shock, bacteremia, endocarditis, and
osteomyelis. Glycopolymers are prime constituents of the S.
aureus cell wall, as part of the biofilm, capsular polysaccharides,
wall teichoic acids, and lipoteichoic acids and the thick peptidoglycan
layer. All these glycopolymers have been found to be promising antigen
candidates.

To date, 13 different serotypes of capsular polysaccharides
(CPs) have been identified from clinical isolates, with capsular polysaccharide
type 5 (CP5) and type 8 (CP8) being the most abundant.344 These two polysaccharides have been targeted
for vaccine development, and conjugates of the natural polymers have
been tested in clinical trials,345−347 unfortunately without
demonstrated efficacy. A pentavalent vaccine is currently in a Ph1
clinical trial.348 The structures of CP5
and CP8 are quite similar. The RU of CP5 is composed of →(4-β-d-ManNAcA-(1–4)-α-l-FucNAc(3-O-Ac)-(1–3)-β-d-FucNAc-(1→ and the RU
of CP8 of →(3-β-d-ManNAcA(4-O-Ac)-(1–3)-α-l-FucNAc-(1–3)-β-d-FucNAc-(1→ units. The syntheses of CP5 and CP8 are
very challenging because of the presence of the 1,2-cis glycosylic linkages and the presence of unusual amino sugars as
well as the critical O-acetyl group. In 2012 Adamo et al.349 reported the first synthesis of a CP5 trisaccharide
(Figure 17). The β-ManNAcA
residue was generated using a 2-O-levulinoyl glucuronate donor (107), which was used to first create a β-glucuronic
acid linkage, after which a C-2- azide was introduced through a substitution
reaction at C-2. Although a spacer was introduced at the reducing
end terminus, this linker could not be used for conjugation purposes
as an acetamide (111) was generated during the deprotection
steps. Competitive ELISA and dot blot studies, with murine anti-CP5
serum, generated against the conjugated polysaccharide, showed recognition
of the synthetic structure, representing a first proof that the trisaccharide
contains the minimal elements for antibody binding.

(B) Synthesis of CP5 trisaccharide, which was recognized by murine
anti-CP5 serum. (C) Synthesis of the CP8 trisaccharide repeating unit,

of WTA RboP substituted tetramer tested in mice. (H) Wall teichoic
acid (WTA) fragments conjugated to recombinant P. aeruginosa exotoxin A (rEPA) induced murine antibodies providing in vitro opsonophagocytic
killing (OPK).

However, in comparison to the
natural polysaccharide, significantly
weaker interaction was observed, suggesting that longer fragments
will be necessary to function as adequate synthetic antigens. To address
the need for longer conjugation-ready structures, different approaches
have been reported. Demchenko and co-workers350 developed another synthetic route, based on inversion of configuration
of a glucose building block to obtain the ManNAc residue, while Boons,351 Codée,352 and Kulkarni312 exploited a direct β-mannosylation
reaction. However, no further immunological evaluation has been reported.

The synthesis of a CP8-fragment has been achieved by Demchenko’s
group, who managed to synthesize both a trisaccharide and a protected
hexasaccharide (Figure 17),353,354 equipped with capping methyl
groups at the points of propagation of the polysaccharide sequence.
No immunological evaluation has thus far been reported. In 2020 Hu
et al.355 reported a synthesis of a CP8
trisaccharide (116) and the initial immunological evaluation
thereof. The introduction of the β-ManNAcA moiety was achieved
by a late-stage epimerization of a glucose precursor. The carboxylic
acid functionality was introduced at the trisaccharide level. To test
the immunogenicity of the trisaccharide, it was conjugated to the
carrier protein CRM197. After immunization of mice with
the glycoconjugate, a glycan array showed the induction of anti-glycan
IgGs. Hybridoma development and subcloning of the secreted antibodies
was used to prepare mAbs. The purified mAbs and serum antibodies were
analyzed for recognition of bacteria by immunofluorescence. Confocal
laser scanning microscopy showed recognition of the bacterial surface
of S. aureus. This data suggests that conjugates
from the synthetic structures could be tested for functional activity
and in infection models to assess their potential as vaccine candidates.
Not only the CPs but also the teichoic acids (TA) of S. aureus have been considered to be promising vaccine candidates.356 TAs are anionic glycopolymers, which are either
covalently attached to the peptidoglycan, as in WTA, or anchored in
the lipid bilayer through hydrophobic interactions, as in LTA. S. aureus WTA is composed of 20–-40 ribitol phosphate
(RboP) repeats, which can be substituted with either α- or β-linked
GlcNAc residues or d-alanine esters.357,358 The most common type of LTA consists of a GroP backbone randomly
decorated with d-alanine or α-GlcNAc moieties. Schmidt
and co-workers have reported a significant amount of work to generate
LTA fragments to probe their innate immune-stimulation activity,359−361 finding that the glycolipid anchor and positively charged alanine
esters on the GroP units were required for full innate immune-stimulation
activity. The potential effect of these fragments in an adaptive immune
response setting has not been investigated. In 2013 Snapper and co-workers
reported a synthesis of a GroP oligomer for potential use in a conjugate
vaccine.362 A 10-mer (119)
was synthesized taking a solid phase approach using a glycerol phosphoramidite
building block (118), where a dimethoxytrityl (DMTr)
was used to protect primary alcohols and a benzoyl (Bz) group to mask
the secondary alcohols, even though these groups can readily migrate
to the neighboring primary hydroxy groups under both basic and acidic
reaction conditions. No characterization data have been provided for
the generated structure.363 The crude product
was conjugated to a TT carrier protein to generate a model vaccine.

Administration in mice of the unconjugated and the TT-conjugated
GroP oligomer adjuvanted with CpG-ODN, a strong TLR9 activator, showed
that a high IgG level was only induced by the conjugate form. The
pooled serum was able to mediate opsonic killing of both the Lowenstein
and the USA300 strains of S. aureus.

An approach
leading to a set of glycosylated LTA fragments has
been reported by Codée’s group as described above.210 Cross-reactivity of serum generated against
a glucosylated GroP hexamer, designed to mimic enterococcal LTA, was
shown.

The glycosylation pattern of RboP-based WTA has been
found to be
critical for the fitness and virulence of bacteria. Different approaches
toward the generation of well-defined WTA fragments have been investigated
including solution and solid phase syntheses. In 2006 Pozsgay and
co-workers successfully synthesized a Rbo-P-8-mer and a Rbo-P-12-mer
using solution phase chemistry. The solid phase assembly of these
fragments proved unsuccessful. The octamer and dodecamer were conjugated
to a BSA carrier protein via an ethanol amine linker introducing 10
to 18 oligomers per protein (130).364 However, the immunogenicity of the conjugates was not studied.
Another approach for the synthesis of S. aureus WTA
RboP was reported by Lee et al.365 Four
building blocks were used to enable the incorporation of different
GlcNAc and d-Ala substitution patterns. The very labile d-Ala ester linkage was replaced in these structures by a robust
amide linkage. The syntheses were achieved using a solution phase
strategy, because attempts to use a solid phase nucleotide synthesizer
required prohibitively large amounts of monomers. The synthesized
tetramers (i.e. 131) were tested in BALB/c mice, where
increased levels of interleukin-6, as a marker of innate immunity
activation, were measured.

Recently, Codée et al. reported
a method to synthesize well-defined
unsubstituted RboP oligomers using both solution and automated solid
phase synthesis approaches.366 The assembled
library of structures consisted of oligomers with and without carbohydrate
substituents, varying in length from hexa- to dodecamers. The phosporamidite
building blocks (121–123) were used
for synthesis with dimethoxytrityl (DMtr) protecting groups to mask
the sites for elongation, in line with contemporary DNA synthesis.
The use of mild acidic deprotection conditions enabled the solid phase
assembly of RboP WTA fragments. For conjugation purposes a phosphoramidite
hexanolamine spacer (125) was used.

Binding studies
with the obtained molecules were conducted by conjugating
the hexamers through a biotin handle to streptavidin-coated magnetic
dynabeads M280 followed by interrogation with monoclonal antibodies.
For this purpose mAbs were generated toward the α-GlcNAc functionalized
RboP WTAs (clones 4461 and 4624) or β-1,4-GlcNAc carrying RboP
WTA (clones 4497 and 6292).367 The antibodies
selectively recognized the glycosylated WTA fragments. Cross-reactivity
of mAbs generated against β-(1–4)-GlcNAc RboP WTA against
the corresponding β-1,3-GlcNAc RboP WTA could be demonstrated.
The nonglycosylated WTA fragments could also be used as substrates
for the S. aureus glycosyl transferases TarM, TarS,
and TarP, capable of introducing α-(1–4)-GlcNAc, β-(1–4)-GlcNAc,
or β-(1–3)-GlcNAc residues. The magnetic bead assay with
these enzymatically glycosylated fragments was used to interrogate
human sera to probe the presence of circulating anti-WTA antibodies.
The β-(1–4)-GlcNAc- and β-(1–3)-GlcNAc-functionlized
WTAs were found to be the most important targets for circulating antibodies,
with significantly less recognition of the α-(1–4)-GlcNAc
WTA. The nonglycosylated RboP WTA was not bound at all by the sera
used.

These findings somewhat contrasted the findings of Gerlach
et al.,368 who reported that β-(1–3)-GlcNAc
WTA was significantly less immunogenic than β-(1–4)-GlcNAc
WTA in a mouse model. The enzymatically glycosylated WTA magnetic
beads were also used to investigate Langerin binding.369 This C-type lectin receptor can be found on
Langerhans cells, that play an important role in sensing the environment
in the skin and kick-start an immune response against invading pathogens.
The synthetic WTA fragments carrying β-GlcNAc substituents bound
Langerin effectively, leading to cellular uptake in an in vitro model,
showing that WTA may be a target for immune surveillance by Langerhans
cells.

A team from Sanofi Pasteur generated three different
WTA fragments,
using a highly convergent synthesis approach, having either an α-(1–4)-GlcNAc
(133), β-(1–4)-GlcNAc (133),
or β-(1–3)-GlcNAc (132) substituent on each
RboP monomer.370 These fragments were conjugated
to detoxified S. aureus α-hemolysin (HladM)
or P. aeruginosa detoxified recombinant exotoxin
A (rEPA) using hydrazide conjugation chemistry. Immunization using
the AF04 adjuvant provided a strong immune response against the conjugates,
while the use of nonconjugated WTA provided a poor response. The use
of the adjuvant was important to raise a high level of antibodies.
Interestingly, the sera raised against the β-(1–4)-GlcNAc-WTA
conjugate proved to be more cross-reactive against different S. aureus strains than the α-(1–4)-GlcNAc-WTA
and β-(1–3)-GlcNAc-WTA conjugate. The immune response
against the latter conjugate was not cross-reactive. The exact reason
for the different binding specificities of the raised antibodies remains
unclear and will require detailed structural studies with well-defined
synthetic WTA fragments.

Overall, the β-(1–4)-GlcNAc-RboP
WTA appears to be
a promising candidate for further development. The role of the labile d-Ala residues in immunogenicity remains to be established.
These positively charged groups may play an important role as they
introduce zwitterionic moieties in the WTA that may render these glycopolymers’
T-cell-independent antigens, in line with the zwitterionic polysaccharides
described above.

Cross-reactive antigens have been explored
for their capacity to
target multiple bacteria, thereby “killing more birds with
one stone”. The cell wall of S. aureus as
well as other bacterial species, fungi, and protozoal parasites produces
the cell surface polysaccharide poly-β-(1–6)-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG, Figure 18A), which in the past decade has been investigated
as a potential application in vaccine development (Table 1).36 The structure of PNAG consists of β-linked N-acetylglucosamine, of which 10–20% of the amino groups are
not N-acetylated (dPNAG).371 Animal models using native PNAG and chemically deacetylated dPNAG
have shown that antibodies against dPNAG were more effective in mediating
opsonophagotic killing372 and protected
mice from staphylococcal infection.373 Chemically
synthesized well-defined structures could be used to define the structure–immunogenicity
relationship and, thus, find the best candidate for a vaccine. In
2007 Nifantiev and co-workers reported a route based on building blocks
(133–135) toward well-defined GlcNAc
and GlcN fragments up to the undecamer level.374 These were equipped with an aminopropyl linker for functionalization.
The synthesis relied on three building blocks, where an N-phthalimide directed the stereochemistry of the glycosylation reactions
via neighboring group participation. For the immunogenicity studies
the acetylated and non-acetylated pentasaccharide and nonasaccharide
were coupled to TT (138).375 Sera from mice immunized with the conjugates of the non-acetylated
oligomers showed higher opsonic activity than the sera obtained from
the acetylated ones. A conjugate of the pentamer has been tested in
a phase I clinical trial, demonstrating the scalability of this synthetic
conjugate for vaccine development.376 Antibodies
to dPNAG have been shown to be highly cross-reactive with numerous
species including AMR pathogens such as A. baumannii, C. difficile, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae and, therefore, are very attractive to further
develop as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.377−379 The mAb F598 is currently in clinical development, and it has been
tested in a human challenge model against N. gonorrhoeae infection. The X-ray structure of the Fab fragment of the mAb in
complex with synthetic dPNAG oligomers has elucidated that F598 recognizes
PNAG through a large groove-shaped binding site that traverses the
entire light and heavy chain interface and accommodates at least five
GlcNAc residues, defining the dPNAG structural epitope.380

PNAG-based universal
vaccine and therapeutic mAb. (B) Synthetic route to the enterobacterial
common antigen (ECA) conjugate used to generate specific sera and
mAbs.

E. coli shares
with all Enterobacteriaceae a polysaccharide known
as the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA),
which is composed of →3)-α-d-Fuc4NAc-(1–4)-β-d-ManNAcA-(1–4)-α-d-GlcNAc-(1→
repeating units that are substoichiometrically (∼70%) decorated
at the GlcNAc C-6 with acetyl esters.381 ECA is important for cell envelope integrity and has been suggested
as a virulence factor, since bacteria that cannot produce ECA exhibit
attenuated infections in oral and intraperitoneal mouse models.382 Therefore, ECA represents an attractive target
for the development of cross-protective vaccines or mAbs. The challenging
synthesis involves the formation of multiple 1,2-cis- glycosyl linkages and the presence of rare monosaccharide constituents.
Boons and co-workers achieved the synthesis of an ECA hexasaccharide
through a [3+3] strategy, using an N-phenyltrifluoroacetimidate
donor readily attainable from (142) (Figure 18B). The assembled oligosaccharide
(143) was conjugated to BSA (145) and shown
to recognize antibodies in sera of mice, exposed to different K. pneumonia strains as well as a mAb, SM250-1A5, raised
against a mixture of six Shigella strains. These
studies have revealed the potential of the ECA trisaccharide and hexasaccharide
in the development of a conjugate vaccine and their potential to raise
potentially cross-reactive mAbs. The effectivity of the ECA antigens
remains to be assessed with respect to capsule and O-antigen expression
of the different bacterial strains.

Candida spp. are fungi
(yeasts) that are part of the microbiome
on human skin, mucous membranes, the female genital tract, and the
gastrointestinal tract. Worldwide, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis
affects about ∼140M women annually, with the highest prevalence
on the 25–34 years age group and an increasing trend of incidence.383Candida spp. are also among
the major causes of nosocomial infection, with invasive candidiasis
gaining increasing prevalence worldwide in parallel with mortality
rates ranging from 10 to 49%.384 The epidemiology
of candidemia has changed due to the increased number of patients
receiving transplants and immunosuppressive therapy, use of broad
spectrum antimicrobials, and number of AIDS patients.385 Particularly, invasive candidiasis was mainly
caused by Candida albicans, but in the past decade
there has been a shift toward Candida spp. non-albicans,
essentially due to the advent of Candida auris, identified
in Japan in 2009 and recently recognized as an emerging multidrug-resistant
pathogen that poses a major global health threat, including in the
US. C. auris can cause invasive infections and outbreaks
with high mortality rates in hospitalized patients, particularly among
patients with multiple comorbidities and who have been admitted to
intensive care or other special care facilities.386−388

Polysaccharides on the fungal surface have been targeted for
vaccine discovery,39 and carbohydrate synthesis
has become a powerful tool to provide pure and well-defined glycan
as opposite to highly variable structures from purification and aid
elucidating protective epitopes and obtaining glycoconjugate vaccines
with an optimized immunological response.389,390

Many syntheses of mannan oligomers391−393 are reported which
have allowed identification of the structure and dimensions of the
protective epitope required for the development of promising vaccine
antigens.394,395 Synthetic conjugates of trisaccharide
β-(1–2)-mannan to TT (146) showed a robust
secondary antibody response in rabbits but poor immunogenicity in
mice (Figure 19).396 A conjugate with a synthetic 14-mer Fba peptide,
derived from the C. albicans cell wall protein, elicited
a strong antibody response and provided protection against a lethal
challenge of C. albicans.397 A tricomponent vaccine where the β-(1–2)-mannan was
conjugated along with the β-glucan Laminarin, as immunopotentiator,
was also constructed and shown to favor the conjugate’s uptake
from dendritic cells in mice, thus increasing its immunogenicity.398 Lately, a fully synthetic conjugated vaccine
(146) (Figure 18A) was constructed from a β-(1–2)-linked mannose
trisaccharide conjugated to a T-cell peptide and an asymmetric dendrimer
component bearing four copies of a β-(1–3)-linked hexaglucan
dendritic cell epitope by click chemistry, yielding a conjugate vaccine
that induced antibodies to all three epitopes of the fully synthetic
construct.399 Other researchers investigated
a series of synthetic oligo α-mannosides containing branches
or not. These synthetic structures were conjugated to BSA via squarate
chemistry, and the immunological evaluation revealed that the linear
oligomannoside structure could influence the quality of the antibody
response.400 Recently, synthetic biotinylated
α-mannooligosaccharides mimicking Candida antigenic
factors using RAW264.7 macrophages have been used to demonstrate their
ability to induce a release of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cytokine signature
patterns.401 It should be noted that α-mannooligosaccharides
decorate human cells and their immunogenicity in humans could not
be optimal. Subsequently, the mannose trisaccharide conjugated to
β-glucan is an essential component of the Candida cell wall and has attracted attention for vaccine development because
of its accessibility to antibodies.402 Antibodies
directed to β-glucan have been shown to confer protection to
mice following challenge with C. albicans,403 and the linear β-(1–3) glucan
with sporadic β-(1–6) branches, Laminarin, which is extracted
from the brown alga Laminaria digitata, has been proposed as an alternative
to fungal glycans in order to avoid any possible contamination from
the microorganism.403,404 Laminarin conjugated to CRM197 induced in mice antibodies which recognized C.
albicans and protected it from lethal challenge with fungal
cells.404 Synthetic oligosaccharides have
been used to elucidate the structural features needed for optimal
immunogenicity. By comparing a linear 15-mer with a branched 17-mer
(147) it was observed that β-(1–6) branches
need to be separated by at least six β-(1–3) residues
for efficient antibody production (Figure 18B).404 Based
on this data, a linear synthetic β-(1–3)-glucan hexamer
(148) was synthesized and conjugated to CRM197, which was shown to elicit in mice anti β-glucan IgGs in a
comparable manner to Lam-CRM197.405 Further investigations were carried out with the β-(1–3)
glucan hexamer regioselectivity conjugated via tyrosine-selective
alkynylation with a 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione spacer followed
by a click chemistry mediated carbohydrate installation (149),406 which was compared to a conjugate
obtained by controlled reaction at the four more surface exposed lysine
residues and the random conjugate (148). In vivo studies
showed that conjugation to four tyrosines is sufficient for a strong
production of antibodies that inhibit the adhesion of C. albicans to human epithelial cells.407,408 More recently, synthetic
octa-, deca-, and dodeca-β-glucans were synthesized and, after
conjugation to KLM, shown to be more immunogenic than the hexamer
with the octamer being the best among these lengths.409

(A) Different types of synthesized β-(1–2)-mannan conjugates
used tested in animal models. (B) β-(1–3)-Glucan conjugates
of different lengths enabling identification of a minimal hexamer
epitope.

C. auris shares
a cell wall glycan composition
with the other Candida spp. However, mannans seem
to avoid triggering the antifungal activity of neutrophils, which
would evoke the innate immune cells to respond to fungal infections,
which could explain a different mechanism of immune evasion for this
pathogen.410 In a recent study, passive
transfer of C3.1, a mAb that targets β-(1–2)-mannotriose
(β-Man3) in the A/J mouse model, which mimics disseminated infection
of human candidiasis, demonstrated a significantly extended survival
and reduced burdens from C. auris in kidney, brain,
and heart.411 The data underpins the potential
of glycan targeting for the design of therapeutics against multidrug-resistant C. auris.

Also, unlike C. albicans, which forms a heterogeneous
architecture of biofilms combined with blastoconidia and hyphae embedded
within the extracellular matrix, C. auris produces
thin biofilms composed mostly of blastoconidia and occasionally pseudohyphae
embedded within a very limited extracellular matrix, which show less
susceptibility to antifungals than those of C. albicans.412 Adhesion plays a key role in C. auris virulence and biofilm formation, and proteins of
the agglutinin-like sequence (Als), in particular Als3393, are involved
in the adhesion of C. auris.413 Recently, the efficacy of the NDV-3A vaccine,414 already tested in women for the prevention
of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, has been reported to protect
neutropenic mice from C. auris infection, with an
additive protective effect when combined with micafungin mice.415

The ongoing SARS-Cov2 pandemic has clearly highlighted the need
for vaccines for pandemic preparedness, capable of inducing sterilizing
antibodies and providing herd immunity.416 Glycoconjugate vaccines represent preventive therapeutics that have
been shown able to induce killing (opsonic or bactericidal) antibodies
and to achieve herd immunity.417 Carbohydrate
targeting for the design of vaccines to combat the possible next pandemic,
AMR, therefore, appears crucial. The combination of synthesis with
structural glycobiology is rationalizing vaccine design, enabling
the generation of a more focused immune response against the most
relevant polysaccharide epitopes.134,418

Further
advances in the synthesis of complex bacterial glycans
will allow the faster generation of more and more complex glycans,
making carbohydrate antigen production faster and more scalable.71,419 Key challenges include not only further optimization of stereoselective
glycosylation methodology and automated synthesis techniques (a technique
that, if sufficiently matured, will also ensure reproducibility of
oligosaccharide synthesis) but also the incorporation of functional
groups, including labile esters, differently functionalized amines/amides,
pyruvate ketals, and phosphates and phosphonates, which often provide
microheterogeneity to the bacterial polysaccharide chains.420 A clear advantage of organic synthesis is the
improvement of specific properties of the glycans, such as stability
(as shown above for carbaMenA,126 Hib,87 and ST5158 pneumococcal
analogues). In some examples, chemically derived structures have the
potential to improve the vaccine design for those polysaccharides
that have been proven less efficacious in humans (e.g. pneumococcal
ST3154).

Due to the complexity of
the synthetic routes for glycans antigens,
large scale manufacturability has historically been considered a challenge
associated with this approach. Today, the success of the Cuban Quimi-Hib
conjugate and scalability for GMP production of Shigella and PNAG vaccines increase the confidence in chemical synthesis
as a tool to supply carbohydrate antigens at the industrial level.18,20 Also, the need for minimal amounts per vaccine dose, as compared
to other chemical therapeutics and the increased availability of
commercial building blocks resulting in reduced cost of goods are
positively contributing to the large scale manufacturability of this
approach. Finally, various glycomimetic drugs and a synthetic heparin
(Fondaparinux) are manufactured at the industrial level and available
in the market.421

A more effective
synthesis methodology will enable the generation
of larger and more complex glycans, which may adopt crucial three-dimensional
structures presenting conformational epitopes that will further resemble
the natural polymers. From this perspective, the use of enzymatic
glycosylations will significantly speed up the assembly of naturally
occurring bacterial oligosaccharides and close analogues thereof,
as has been shown for the production of the MenX CPS.68 At present, the vast majority of the reported enzymatic
oligosaccharide syntheses have been directed at the assembly of mammalian
glycans, featuring the most common monosaccharide donors. Bacteria
use a much wider monosaccharide panel for the construction of their
polysaccharides. Expression of the relevant biosynthesis enzymes (besides
the transferases also the enzymes that generate the nucleotide donor
monosaccharides) and their use in the assembly of bacterial glycan
epitopes will streamline bacterial glycan assembly.

Novel nanosized
carriers favoring multimeric and optimal spatial
presentation of short glycans may improve the immunogenicity of glycoconjugate
vaccines, increasing the antibody avidity or breadth of the immune
response. Novel site-selective protein conjugation chemistries are
emerging to achieve better control over the carbohydrate–protein
linkages. Not only the number of glycans per carrier protein but also
the position on the protein may impact vaccine efficacy. Improved,
site-selective ligation chemistry will allow the generation of multivalent
conjugate vaccines, in which several epitopes can be connected to
a single protein carrier, which can be a pathogen derived protein,
also playing the role of antigen.

Very few adjuvants have been
so far tested with conjugated synthetic
carbohydrates (Freund adjuvant, Alum salts, and MF59 to mention some),
and the effect of adjuvantation on this type of structures has not
been thoroughly explored. The combination with well-defined molecular
adjuvants (such as TLR, NLR, RIG, and STING ligands) and targeting
devices is expected to further improve vaccine efficiency.422−424 In particular, there is a need for potent and effective adjuvants
to be combined with glycoconjugate vaccines in elderly, hospitalized,
and immunocompromised patients where the need for therapies counteracting
AMR is higher.425 In combination with better
defined delivery vehicles, such as polymers or supramolecular architectures,
another level of control is introduced. The availability of well-defined
glycans is mandatory to allow optimization of all these important
vaccine parameters.

Finally, synthetic chemistry, in combination
with chemical biology
techniques and advanced microscopy, will enable studies to provide
insight into how conjugate vaccines are taken up and processed by
the host immune system.426 This will enable
the rational optimization of all steps required in the immunization
process to achieve optimal delivery, uptake, processing, and presentation
to the right partners of the immune system alongside optimal activation
of all players involved. We believe that all these advancements will
render carbohydrates a major player to defeat emerging AMR. While
the RNA platform will be used more and more for the expression of
protein antigens, progress in carbohydrate synthesis and conjugation
will allow better exploitation of the peculiar role of carbohydrates
as vaccine targets and create the next generation of glycovaccines.
