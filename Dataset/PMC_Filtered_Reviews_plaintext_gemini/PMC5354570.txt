Title: Genital Herpes: Insights into Sexually Transmitted Infectious
Disease

Genital herpes is one of the most common, persistent and highly infectious sexually
transmitted viral infections mostly caused by herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) and in
many emerging first time cases, by HSV-1 1.
Primary and recurrent genital herpes infections most commonly result in lesions and
inflammation around the genital area. In women, the sites of infection are mainly
the vulva and the vagina, with some cases involving the regions of cervix and
perianal. In heterosexual men infection is typically on the glans or the shaft of
the penis, whereas anal infection is also reported with homosexual men. More than
500 million people are infected worldwide and most cases reported are among the age
groups between 16-40 years that coincides with increased sexual activity among this
age group 2. While these numbers are an
estimate, the actual numbers may be underestimated as many people are either
asymptomatic or are unaware of the infection 3. This review provides an insight into the epidemiology, pathology, our
current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of infection and the currently
available and upcoming treatments for genital herpes.

Herpesviruses are among the most ubiquitous of human infections. After infection with
HSV, it is thought that the virus and the immune response to the virus persist
through the life of the host. HSV infections are measured by testing various
populations for the presence of antibodies specific to the virus. An estimated 90%
of all people worldwide have one or both viruses 45. HSV-1 is the more prevalent
virus with 65% of persons in the United States having antibodies to HSV-1 6, while HSV-2 infections are markedly less
frequent, with 15%-80% of people in various populations infected 7. HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection rates widely vary
between countries. The increase in genital HSV-1 is mainly attributed to an increase
in oral sex among youngsters and adults which is viewed safer than intercourse 8. Due to this, in the USA, Canada, and other
European countries, at least half of the first episodes for genital herpes have been
caused by HSV-1 in the past decade 9101112. In a study performed by the
CDC it is estimated that about one in six Americans aged 14 to 49 are infected with
HSV-2 and the prevalence in women was 20.9%, twice as high as among men 13. While a surge of HSV-2 seroprevalence from
16.4% to 21.8% was observed from 1976 to 1994 14, this trend has reversed, dropping to 17.2% in 2004 15. In Africa and other developing countries,
there is a high burden of HSV-2 infections with >50% prevalence in the population
16. Around 82% of women and 53% of men in
the Sub-Saharan Africa are seropositive for HSV-2 17. HSV-2 infection rates also depend on the rates of sexual activity
and are more prevalent in heavily exposed populations, such as commercial sex
workers, who are nearly 100% positive, suggesting an urgent need for education and
new measures for prevention 18.

The HSV-1/HSV-2 virion recognizes and attaches to the heparan sulfate
proteoglycan via glycoproteins on the viral envelope. By a process called
‘surfing’, the virus particles can travel along filopodia-like membrane
extensions to reach the surface of the cell. On the surface of the cell,
viral capsid penetration can occur by fusion of envelop with the plasma
membrane (I), or alternatively by endocytosis of enveloped virions with
eventual fusion of the envelope with a vesicular membrane (II). In either
case, gD on the virus envelope is required via its interaction with one of
the receptors (shown in red): herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) or nectin-1
and-2. In the cytoplasm, the capsid (brown) travels to the nucleus where the
viral DNA is released. Multiple rounds of replication result in multiple
copies of viral DNA and other components that get packaged and assembled in
the nucleus. During egress, the newly assembled capsid gets its primary
envelope at the peri-nuclear membrane, which is lost during egress from the
outer nuclear membrane. Naked capsid travels through the cytoplasm where it
receives the tegument and the viral envelope (presumably from the Golgi or
the ER). Heparanase (denoted as pink spots) is an enzyme that was recently
described in aiding viral egress. The enzyme cleaves of cell surface heparan
sulfate (dotted black) which clears the path for the virus to exit the
cell.

HSV are linear, double stranded DNA viruses capable of establishing latency in
humans. They belong to the family of Herpesviridae and more specifically to the
sub-family of Alphaherpesvirinae. There are two sub-types: HSV-1 and HSV-2 that are
closely related but differ slightly in tissue tropism and antigenic properties. The
viral DNA is present in the core that is enclosed in a protein shell called the
capsid (Fig. 1). The icosahedral shaped capsid is ~125 nm in diameter, which is
connected to and surrounded by a glycoprotein expressing lipid bilayer membrane
envelope via a protein coat called the tegument. The viral envelope contains at
least 12 glycoproteins many of which play major roles in the entry and egress of the
virus. A list of HSV glycoproteins along with their reported functions is provided
in Table 1.

List of HSV glycoproteins and their reported functions.

The lifecycle of HSV has been mostly studied and characterized using HSV-1
infections. However, HSV-2 infections are considered similar to HSV-1 infections.
Different stages in the HSV lifecycle can be broadly classified into:

i. Attachment: Initiation of infection begins with the attachment of
viral glycoproteins to the cell surface. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on
the cells serve as attachment sites for HSV 19. Glycoproteins B and C (gB and gC) on the HSV envelop bind to the
HSPGs and are essential to initiate attachment. A study by Herold et
al., using a gB and gC null virus showed reduction in the overall virus
attachment to the cells as well as reduction in virus infectivity 20. Moreover, it has been shown that in the
absence of gC gB can take over and help in attachment to cells, indicating a
gC-independent mode of viral attachment 33.
HSV was shown to bind to HS (heparan sulfate) on the filopodia, which are plasma
membrane protrusions, and use filopodial interaction to migrate towards the cell
body to initiate entry. This process was termed "viral surfing" 34. In this study, viral particles were shown
to surf along the filopodia and the formation of filopodial structures increased
upon HSV infection, possibly due to activation of Rho GTPase signaling during virus
attachment to cells. Fluorescence imaging revealed that HSPG expression is higher
along the filopodial structures. This mode of attachment has also been reported for
vaccinia virus, human papilloma virus type 16, hepatitis C virus, and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 35.

ii. Entry: After the initial attachment to the cell surface, virus entry
is the next step in the lifecycle. Various modes of viral entry have been
established. The virus is taken into the cells by either direct fusion with the
plasma membrane, which is independent of pH change, or through endocytosis mediated
by specific cellular receptors. The glycoprotein D (gD) on HSV plays an important
role in both of the aforementioned uptake processes and glycoproteins H and L (gH
and gL) act in concert to complete the fusion machinery. To date the following
receptors have been identified for gD: herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), nectin-1
and -2 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate (3-OS HS) 21. HVEM was the first identified HSV receptor that belongs to the tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. The next set of receptors identified is
represented by nectin-1 and -2. They belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The
last receptor is a rare modification of the large sugar molecule HS mediated by the
3-O-sulfotransferase 3 (3-OST-3). 3-OST-3 belongs to the family of 3-O
sulfotransferases (3-OSTs) that place sulfate groups at the 3-OH position on the
glucosamine in HS. This specific and rare modification of HS dictates the biological
activity of HS and occurs during the last step of HS biosynthesis. As an example,
modification of HS by 3-OST-1 serves as a binding site for antithrombin, a major
player in anticoagulation 36. 3-OST-3
modified HS serves as an entry receptor for HSV and addition of soluble form of 3-OS
HS in HSV resistant cell lines showed increased viral entry 3839. Interestingly,
3-OST-3 generated receptor fails to mediate HSV-2 entry but may probably help in the
attachment of HSV-2 1938.

Viral entry can occur in the presence of any one of the aforementioned receptors and
absence of all three receptors abolishes viral entry. Even though gD is needed for
receptor-mediated endocytosis and also for the direct fusion of viral envelop to the
plasma membrane, there seems to be no clear consensus on how and which mode of entry
the viruses use in human hosts or animal models. While entry into some cultured
cells like CHO, HeLa and HCEs are reported to be through receptor mediated
endocytosis, entry into Vero and neuronal cell lines are through direct fusion with
the plasma membrane 3940. In addition to gD playing a vital role in viral entry,
accumulating evidence also suggests the important role of gB in HSV entry as a gB
null virus was unable to enter and cause infection in target cells 41. Paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor
α (PILRα) has been shown to associate with gB to function as a co-receptor in aiding
HSV-1 entry. Mutations on the sites where gB attaches to PILRα not only reduced
viral entry but also reduced viral replication and neuroinvasiveness 424344. Furthermore, another
protein that belongs to the sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin family which shares a
similar homology to PILRα called the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) acts as a
co-receptor for HSV-1 entry when expressed exogenously 45. Another co-receptor called non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA)
was also identified to bind gB on the cell surface and aide in the viral entry 46. As an actin binding motor protein, NM-IIA
plays a critical role in cell adhesion and migration. The glycoproteins gH and gL
together with gB and gD form the fusion complex 4748. gH exists as a
hetero-oligomeric complex with gL. This complex is essential for the processing and
cell surface expression of gH 4950 and is conserved in many of the
herpesviruses 51. Apart from playing a role
in the fusion machinery, the gH/gL complex plays a role in virus entry by
interacting with various cell surface proteins 52, integrins being the most common. Interaction of gH with integrin
αvβ3 facilitates HSV-2 viral entry and calcium signaling in human genital tract
epithelial cells 53. Another study shows that
αvβ6 and αvβ8 serve as interchangeable receptors for gH/gL that promote endocytosis
and activation of membrane fusion 54. A
recent study by the same group also found that conformational changes in the above
mentioned integrin receptors are essential to promote the dissociation of gL from
the gH/gL complex, a proposed new mechanism in HSV viral entry 55.

Other alternative modes of viral entry have also been identified. A phagocytosis-like
uptake of the virus particles was reported to be observed once the virus particles
have attached to the filopodia; it is believed to exhibit mixed traits of
endocytosis and phagocytosis 56. Cytoskeleton
rearrangement and their associated cellular signaling pathways have also been
implicated in facilitating HSV entry into cells 57. Rho-GTPase signaling pathway involving Rho-A and cdc42, key
modulators in the formation of filopodia, were shown to be activated and aide in the
phagocytic-like uptake of the virus 56.
Another signaling pathway called phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is
involved in the downstream of the filopodial formation, was also found to affect
multiple steps in the HSV entry 58. This same
pathway is also implicated to control the activity of cofilin, a family of
actin-binding proteins, in facilitating entry of virus into neuronal cells 59. The activation of Akt signaling in
triggering calcium release which aids in HSV viral entry has also been shown 60.

iii. Capsid Transport and Replication: Upon successful entry into cells,
the viral capsid and tegument proteins are released into the cytoplasm. The virion
host shutoff protein (vhs) is a viral tegument protein that is released into the
cytoplasm after entry and degrades host mRNAs that regulate stress response. The
capsid then translocates to the nucleus along microtubules via the dynein and
dynactin motor proteins and releases the viral DNA into the nucleoplasm 616263. A recent study reported the
role of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) to be involved with HSV capsid transport to
the nucleus via interaction with acetylated α-tubulin 64. The uncoating of viral DNA occurs at the nuclear pore.

iv. Replication and Assembly: Once inside the nucleus, several viral
genes are expressed in an ordered fashion. The proteins of the α genes or
intermediate early (IE) genes are the first to be transcribed. The products of these
genes are termed as infected cell protein (ICP) and there are five ICPs: 0, 4, 22,
27 and 47. The virus encodes a tegument protein: VP16 that aids in the transcription
of the α genes. The expression of ICP4 is then thought to drive the expression of
the β genes or the early genes. The β genes encode for various proteins that promote
viral DNA replication, including the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK). The virus
utilizes TK for replication leading to the expression of the γ or late genes. The
proteins of the γ genes encode for several components of the viral structure
including capsid and envelop proteins. Various viral components are formed which
then assemble and the viral DNA is repackaged into a new capsid. Fully assembled
capsid exits from the nucleus by acquiring a glycoprotein-containing envelop at the
inner nuclear membrane and losing it at the outer membrane when the naked capsid is
released in the cytoplasm for re-envelopment using a Golgi-derived membrane (Fig.
1).

v. Autophagy Modulation during Active Replication: The role of
autophagy, a cellular process involved in maintaining the metabolic and homeostatic
activity, in HSV replication has been widely studied. The ICP34.5 protein, a
neurovirulence factor, regulates the replication of HSV by controlling the
autophagic pathway via inhibition of either PKR/eIF2a signaling pathway 6566 or
beclin-1, a protein involved in the formation of autophagosomes 67. A recent study showed that a basal level of
autophagy is needed for efficient replication of virus and disrupting the basal
level would lead to reduced viral titers 68.
Another recent study showed the role of a host cytoplasmic protein called axin in
controlling autophagy and HSV replication 69.
The results from this study indicate that axin expression reduces the levels of
cellular autophagy induced by HSV, resulting in enhanced HSV replication.

vi. Latency and Reactivation: One of the key traits of this family of
viruses is to go latent for the life of the host after primary infection. How and
why the virus goes latent is only partially understood and is one of the hot topics
in herpes research. After a lytic infection the virus has the ability to evade and
mask itself from the host defense. Latency is established when the virus migrates to
the sensory ganglia via a retrograde fashion and invades the nucleus of the neurons
(Fig. 2). In the nucleus the HSV genome is maintained in a circular form and remains
in a silent state. During this state, a region of the genome that encodes for the
latency associated transcripts (LATs) remains active 70. Kramer et al. also showed the presence of HSV
transcripts using RT-PCR analyses in latently infected mouse ganglia 7172.
The exact role and function of the LATs also remains to be completely understood.
However, research over the last decade has revealed the common functions of LAT:
they help in reducing the expression of the viral genome thereby maintaining them in
a latent state protected from the immune system 73 and they protect infected neurons from apoptosis, thus increasing the
amount of latent transcripts that would eventually increase the viral load upon
reactivation 7475. In addition, the host immune system has also been
implicated to play a vital role in viral latency. Studies in the mouse models of
latent HSV infection revealed the presence of infiltrating immune cells and
cytokines in latently infected ganglia 767778 while some suggest that the presence of low viral transcript
levels could lead to a local milieu of immune effectors that could repress HSV gene
expression 7980. Some evidence also suggests the role of neuronal functio in
maintaining latency 818283. Furthermore,
during latent infection, the ability of some parts of the HSV genome to remain
transcriptionally active and inactive suggested the presence of epigenetic control.
Two studies that used computational analysis and latently infected mice revealed
that DNA methylation, a most common epigenetic mechanism, did not regulate HSV
latent gene expression 8485, leading to the investigation of other
epigenetic mechanisms.

Primary infection occurs when a host is exposed to the virus for the first
time. When a person is exposed to HSV, the virus infects the epithelial
cells. Depending on the immune system of the host, lytic infection leads to
virus shedding that can cause symptoms such as ulcers or remain
asymptomatic. After lytic infection, the virions reach the nerve endings and
through a retrograde transport, reach the sacral ganglion where it
establishes latency till the life of the host. Recurrent infections occur
when the virus gets reactivated due to stress, environmental conditions and
other unknown factors. Reactivation causes the virus from the sacral
ganglion to travel to the site of primary infection or high nerve endings
via an anterograde fashion where virus shedding can cause symptoms or remain
asymptomatic depending on the host immune system.

The role of chromatin and HSV latency has gained increasing popularity as the HSV DNA
is devoid of histones 86 but upon infection
gets assembled into the nucleosome 87 and
associates with histones 88. However whether
heterochromatin or euchromatin play a role in HSV latency was not known. Only
recently, using various molecular techniques, the presence of heterochromatin or
euchromatin in HSV-infected cells has been studied to provide a basis for a
chromatin-based epigenetic mechanism of HSV gene regulation in different cell types
89. In a study by Kubat et
al., their findings showed that active chromatin was associated with
LAT gene as increasing levels of acetylated H3 histone were found to be associated
with the LAT promoter and enhancer compared with the ICP0 gene 90. In another study by Wang et al., it was
shown that as latent infection is established the HSV lytic genes are progressively
associated with chromatin that contains dimethylation of H3K9me2, which is an
indicator of heterochromatin 91. Thus there
is a general notion that during latent infection the LAT gene is associated with
euchromatin whereas the lytic genes are associated with heterochromatin. The study
by Amelio et al. gave insights into how and why different chromatin
are maintained and regulated separately on the latent viral genome 92. Their study identified candidate insulator
elements, DNA sequences that bind protein factors that maintain chromatin
boundaries. These contain CCCTC sites that are bound by the CCCTC-binding factor
(CTCF) upstream of the LAT promoter boundary and in the LAT intron. They proposed
that insulators keep the LAT euchromatin activity within a boundary and
heterochromatin outside of the same boundary.

Reactivation of the latent virus occurs when an external stimuli or ‘stress’ is
applied to the neuron. Various factors such as environmental conditions, fever,
exposure to sunlight and other unknown conditions have been attributed to cause
reactivation but their exact targets at the molecular level remain unknown. When the
virus reactivates it travels from the sensory ganglia via anti-retrograde fashion to
the primary infection site or sites of high neuron innervations where active virus
replication and shedding occur and symptoms like pain, inflammation and lesions
develop. In an effort to understand the exact role of LATs in the reactivation of
HSV, LAT encoded micro RNAs (miRNA) were discovered. miRNAs are a family of
non-coding RNA that is approximately 22 nucleotides in length. They usually function
at a post-transcription level by inhibiting protein synthesis via mRNA degradation.
HSV miRNAs have been shown to be expressed during productive infection, which helps
degrade host immune responses as well as during latency, which helps in establishing
latency or helps in reactivation 93.

vii. Egress: Upon formation of capsid and packaging of the virus DNA,
the virions eventually have to egress or leave the nucleus and the cell to get into
the extracellular environment. While the process of HSV egress still requires some
clarity due to varying experimental models and complexity in studying the
virus-nuclear interactions, the following is the accepted model for viral egress.
Budding is the initial step in the nuclear egress of HSV. In this process the capsid
acquires the envelope from the inner nuclear membrane and two viral proteins: UL31
and UL34 are reported to be necessary for the budding process 94. Once the virus reaches the perinuclear region, it is
thought to lose the primary envelope or undergoes de-envelopment and evidence
suggests that the final assembly of tegument, envelope and the glycoproteins occur
within the cytoplasmic compartments (presumably in the Golgi or Endoplasmic
Reticulum, ER). During productive infection either in primary infection or after
reactivation, for efficient transmission and infection, the virus needs to spread to
neighboring cells. The release of the virus from infected cells requires both host
factors and viral components. Among the viral components, glycoproteins E and I (gE
and gI) are needed for efficient spread of viruses in certain polarized and
non-polarized epithelial cells and neuronal cells 9522. Among the host factors, a
HS degrading enzyme: heparanase (HPSE) has been recently shown to aide in viral
egress 96. The study shows how the levels of
HPSE increase over time with HSV infection as active form of HPSE is translocated to
the plasma membrane of infected cells to remove HS for smoother release of newly
generated virions. The role of myosin motor proteins such as NMIIA and myoVa have
also been implicated in HSV egress 9798.

Genital herpes is predominantly transmitted through sexual contact. Viral
transmission by oro-genital contact is mostly HSV-1 and therefore the number of
genital HSV-1 cases is on the rise 99100101. Virus shedding is more predominant in sites like mouth and mucosal
surfaces such as the vagina. Contact with any one of these increases the risk of
being infected with HSV.

An episode or outbreak is termed as the phase in which individuals experience
symptoms and the severity of these episodes depends on previous immunity to HSV.
Notably, almost 25% of people presenting with a first clinical episode of genital
herpes have serological evidence of past HSV-2 infection at the time of
presentation, suggesting initial infection was asymptomatic 102. In many other instances of primary infections where the
patient encounters HSV for the first time the first episode may occur anywhere
between 2 days to 2 weeks after primary infection. Primary infections are clinically
most severe and most likely symptomatic 103.
Symptoms like fever, itching and muscle pains usually in the lower part of the body
are most common in primary infection; 40% of men and 70% of women also report fever,
headache, malaise, and myalgias 104. Papule
formulation followed by a wide distribution of blisters or lesions appear around the
genital areas that eventually break to form ulcers (Fig. 2). Over a period of time
the ulcers crust and heal. In women common sites for lesion are the cervix, vagina,
labia majora and minora and perianal region through infected vaginal fluid and in
men it is mostly on the shaft or the glans of the penis. Anal lesions are also
reported in homosexual men. Primary infections either by HSV-1 or by HSV-2 cannot be
differentiated just by clinical symptoms; additional laboratory testing is needed to
differentiate between the two viruses.

At the tissue and molecular level, HSV-2 infects the epithelial cells on the genital
mucosa leading to an increase in inflammatory response and cell death at the site of
infection. Multinucleated cells and syncytia formation are the most common
observation in cells infected with HSV. The recruitment of macrophages, natural
killer cells, B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity 105106 and the release of
cytokines has been reported to play a role in innate and adaptive immunity to HSV
infections. This contributes to a chronic inflammatory state in genital skin and
mucosa. Histopathologic studies of foreskin in HIV-seronegative men after adult
circumcision have shown a higher concentration of CD4+ and
CD8+ T-cells in HSV-2-seropositive compared with HSV-2-seronegative
men 107. During the course of primary
infection, the virus spreads via a retrograde fashion along the microtubules lining
the axons to the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) where the neuronal cells act as
reservoirs for the virus to remain latent 108. Upon reactivation due to factors such as stress and other unknown
conditions, the virus spreads from the DRG to the epithelial cells via an
anterograde fashion where a lytic replication of the virus follows, resulting in
virus shedding. This is the cause of recurrent infections and these infections are
usually asymptomatic or may be associated with a classic genital ulcer. While the
innate immune system, specifically the CD8+ T-cells and the plasmacytoid
dendritic cells, are attributed in controlling latency and reactivation of the virus
80109110, recent reports suggest
otherwise. Studies have shown that CD8α dendritic cells help drive the establishment
of HSV-1 latency 111112. At a clinical and subclinical level, the severity of
viral reactivation varies widely from person to person and depends on cell mediated
immunity that is considered important for control of viral replication 113114.

Diagnosis of genital herpes based purely on clinical presentation is often not
accurate and could be misleading. Symptoms occurring from other bacterial infections
like Treponema pallidum or Haemphilus ducreyi
could be confused with HSV resulting in wrong diagnosis 115. Genital herpes may also cause atypical symptoms that
occur at unusual sites such as the thighs or the buttocks. HSV-2 is also found to be
a co-factor for HIV-1, which is one of the leading causes of sexually transmitted
infections and at times it becomes difficult to diagnose the symptoms that occur due
to HIV-1 co-infections 116. Hence, along
with clinical diagnosis, laboratory tests are required to accurately diagnose
genital herpes. To determine the presence of HSV in laboratory, swabs from the
genital lesions are taken and tested by the following common techniques:

i. Viral culture of HSV has been a gold standard for laboratory
diagnosis of HSV for the past two decades. Using the swabs from the genital lesions,
the virus can be grown on tissue culture, usually within 5 days, that is then
detected using immunofluorescence assays or by enzyme immunoassay. The limitation
with this method is that it lacks sensitivity as more viruses are usually obtained
from patients with primary infection (80%) but less from patients with recurrent
infections (20-50%) or patients whose lesions have begun to heal 117.

ii.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): This method of nucleic acid
amplification has emerged as the next common method to assess the presence of HSV.
Determining HSV by PCR is faster and four times more sensitive compared to viral
culture 118119. Based on this method, three assays have been approved by the US
Food and Drug Association for the detection of HSV in genital lesions. These include
IsoAmp HSV Assay, BioHelix Corporation; MultiCode-RTx Herpes Simplex Virus 1 & 2
Kit, EraGen Biosciences, Inc. and BD ProbeTec Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV I & 2)
QX Amplified DNA Assays, BD Diagnostic Systems. With increasing technology and
advances in kit developments for HSV detection and typing using PCR, this method is
rapidly replacing the viral culture assay.

iii.
Serotyping: This method can not only be used to detect the presence of
HSV but can also be used to differentiate between genital herpes originating from
HSV-1 or HSV-2. Type-specific IgG against the glycoprotein G (gG) of HSV-1 and HSV-2
are available that can be used to distinguish between the two viruses 120. Serotyping has another advantage in that
it detects the presence of HSV to confirm if the infection is a primary or recurrent
infection. In primary infection, type-specific HSV antibodies can take from 2 weeks
to 3 months to develop. Therefore, an initial absence of IgG antibodies specific for
gG and subsequent development of such antibodies after 12 weeks confirms new HSV
infection. Clinicians also recommend this method to diagnose genital herpes when
there are no lesions or the above mentioned detection tests do not provide
substantial results.

While this review only mentions the above common techniques to diagnose genital
herpes in a laboratory setting, there are currently other methods and techniques
being developed by research institutes and companies. For example, LeGoff et
al. provide a detailed description of other available and upcoming
diagnostic methods 121.

Genital herpes conditions are primarily treated with antivirals that aim at
controlling viral replication. Acyclovir, its analogue Valacyclovir and Famcyclovir
(prodrug of Pencyclovir) are currently prescribed for genital herpes treatment.
These drugs are nucleoside analogues that specifically inhibit the herpesvirus DNA
polymerase. While cyclovir is available in oral and intravenous formulations,
Valacyclovir and Famcyclovir are available only as oral formulations. For primary
infections where the symptoms can be severe, antiviral therapy is usually started
even before the symptoms are confirmed by laboratory diagnosis and the duration of
the therapy is 7-10 days or till the lesions are healed 122. In severe cases, to relieve pain, clinicians recommend
the use of analgesics or sitz baths where the patients’ hips and buttocks are
immersed in lukewarm water 117.

Preventive strategies to efficiently reduce the transmission of the virus also exist
and in combination with the above mentioned treatments there could probably be a
significant reduction of viral transmission. In the case of people that have
symptomatic viral shedding, the most common preventive strategy is to abstain from
sexual activity or to use condoms. A prospective study showed significantly lowered
levels of viral acquisition among partners that used male condoms 123. Although it is thought that female
condoms can also reduce virus transmission, this has not been clinically
investigated. Applications of topical microbicides to prevent genital herpes
infections are also being investigated. This strategy involves the use of natural or
synthetic products that either increase the natural vaginal defenses or inactivate
the HSV virions 124125. A recent study showed that vaginal application of
tenofovir gel, an antiviral microbicide which functions as a nucleotide
reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, reduced the levels of HSV-2 acquisition among women
in South Africa 5.

Various other therapeutic and prevention strategies that target different stages of
virus lifecycle are currently being investigated. Peptide therapeutics is fast
rising owing to the ease of synthesis, modifications and their high specificity
126. They are being synthesized and used
as inhibitors against HSV infections 127.
The TAT (transactivator of transcription)-peptide, derived from HIV, has been shown
to inhibit infection of HSV in the in vitro and in
vivo models of HSV infections 128129. A study showed the
effect of a synthetic 3-OS HS specific peptide: G2 in blocking HSV-2 infections in
human cervical (HeLa) cell lines. This peptide significantly blocked the entry and
thereby the spread of the virus 130 and a
D-enantiomer of this peptide exhibits higher stability and more promise in
inhibiting HSV infection 131. Another study
designed synthetic peptides specific to the glycoproteins gD and gG and showed that
these peptides can effectively recognize HSV-2 antibodies and hence may be used for
serodiagnostic assays 132. Because HSV
utilizes the cytoskeleton filaments and kinases during its entry, a recent study
showed that blocking the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) with inhibitors such as
blebbistatin significantly reduces HSV infection 133, providing new evidence for potential targets in blocking HSV
infections. The advent of nanoparticles in drug delivery was successful, owing to
their ability to provide sustained or extended delivery of drugs at a local site.
Nanoparticles or nanoparticle compositions to protect against HSV-2 infections are
also being actively researched. Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles exhibited significant
antiviral activity in both the in vitro model using vaginal
epithelial cells and the in vivo mice model of HSV-2 infections
134. Three different modes of treatment
were used in this study: prophylaxis, therapeutic and neutralization. In all the
three modes of treatment, the ZnO nanoparticles showed promising results in blocking
HSV-2 infections. Another study showed the potential antiviral use of
mucus-penetrating nanoparticles 135. In this
study, acyclovir monophosphate loaded mucus-penetrating nanoparticles showed an
increase in drug retention and distribution thereby providing an effective
protection against HSV-2 challenge.

Protection against genital herpes infections can be enhanced by induction of
protective immune responses using vaccines. Vaccines against genital herpes are
underway and in the majority of clinical trials only prophylactic vaccines have seen
success so far. There have been no reports of any therapeutic vaccines that show
promise against genital herpes infections. These vaccines consist of subunits of
glycoproteins such as gD or gB. A gD2 subunit vaccine, when administered with alum
as adjuvant, showed around 39-46% efficacy in preventing HSV-2 infections in
patients that were seronegative for HSV-1 and HSV-2 but did not provide protection
to patients that were seropositive for HSV-1 136137. Other viral
glycoproteins such as gC and gE are also being used as vaccines to study their
effectivity in blocking genital herpes infections 138139. Peptide based vaccines
are also being developed to incite immune responses against HSV-2 infections. A
study developed a peptide based vaccine: HerpV, which generates CD4+ and
CD8+ responses when subjected to HSV-2 challenge 140141.

There is no doubt that our understanding of HSV-2 lifecycle and associated
pathogenesis has improved dramatically over the last several years but challenges
remain in many areas, especially those relating to disease management and
prevention. The new knowledge has provided a major opportunity to develop new
strategies for patient care by combining our understanding of viral infection
mechanisms, host immune responses, and the viral mechanisms that subvert them. New
anti-HSV drugs are on the horizon, many of which may target other herpesviruses as
well. At present, the development of vaccines against HSV-2 is a highly active area
of research and many innovative strategies are currently being tested for an
effective vaccine generation. Future clinical trials will see many new,
non-nucleoside anti-herpetic drug candidates as well as many newer approaches,
including immune-based therapeutics. An area that needs extra attention is rapid
diagnostics, especially since genital herpes can be caused by both HSV-1 and HSV-2.
Therefore quick and easily available tests can yield much better results in reducing
symptoms and lowering transmission rate. Any success in reducing transmission rate
will mean a step closer to the greatest challenge for herpes virologists, which is
complete elimination of this lifelong infection.
