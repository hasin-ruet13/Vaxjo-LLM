Title: Immunostimulatory
Polymers as Adjuvants, Immunotherapies,
and Delivery Systems

Polymers hold immense
potential for the development of novel therapeutics.
On account of their high molecular weights, tunable properties, and
ability to assemble into ordered nano- and microstructures, polymers
can deliver molecular cargo, form interactions with biological molecules,
and target specific cell subsets, making them potent tools for treatment
of disease or modulation of biological systems.1−3 While such applications
of polymers are commonly exploited, it has also become apparent that
polymers hold an innate immunostimulatory capacity, which can result
in enhanced immune responses or toxic side-effects when applied in
therapeutic modalities.4 Indeed, nature’s
polymers, such as bacterial peptidoglycans and single-stranded DNA,
are potent immunogens that are critical for immune recognition of
“non-self” or “damaged-self” from “self”
(e.g., recognizing viral or cancerous proteins from endogenous proteins).5−7 Polymeric adjuvants can enhance cellular uptake,8 bind immune receptors with higher affinity and avidity,9 and alter pharmacokinetics10 relative to small molecule adjuvants. Synthetic alternatives
to nature’s polymers offer a low-cost and tunable parameter
space for the design of new adjuvants and delivery systems that can
be prepared with optimized biological responses.

The premise
that polymers can modulate innate and adaptive immune
responses has a remarkably long precedent. In the 1930s, Goebel and
Avery reported several landmark studies demonstrating that conjugation
of carbohydrate polymers to proteins could modulate the immune response
in a pneumococcus vaccine.11,12 Later, researchers
in the 1960s identified that hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene
glycol), alginates, and methylcelluloses were safe for use as drug
excipients or surgical tools, while other hydrocarbons such as polystyrene
and poly(vinyl chloride) were less favorable for biological applications.13,14 Similar property–activity relationships were developed through
the 1980s and provide a foundational understanding of polymer biocompatibility
today. Work in the 1990s demonstrated that polymers could be synthesized
with precise chemistries to deliver small molecules, proteins, or
oligonucleotides with controlled release kinetics, biodistribution,
and immune responses.15−20 Today, the ascent of controlled polymerization techniques combined
with sophisticated monomer design21 has
allowed a breadth of polymers to be used in biomedical applications
such as tissue scaffolds, drug delivery systems, drug excipients,
antimicrobial coatings, and gene therapies, to name a few. Specific
to clinical immunology, polymers are critical components of liposomal
and nanoparticulate vaccine formulations,1,4,22 transfection reagents for CAR T cell production
and oncological gene therapies,4,17,23 and compatibilizing agents for stents and devices.4 Growth in the use of polymers in these applications requires
an increased molecular understanding of interactions between polymers
and the immune system to allow for the development of safe and improved
therapeutics.

In this Perspective, we discuss the current status
of immunostimulatory
polymers for therapeutic applications. While polymers employed for
drug delivery and nanomedicine have been extensively reviewed,2,24,25 herein we discuss the immune
response directed toward polymers independent of cargo or other extrinsic
stimuli. Rather than focus on specific disease contexts, we instead
discuss design principles necessary for directing an immune response
using one of four classes of materials: (1) biologically derived (or
biologically inspired) polymers that bind known pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs, described below), (2) synthetic polymers that bind
known PRRs, (3) polymers that are covalently conjugated to or noncovalently
formulated with PRR ligands to enhance adjuvanticity, and (4) polymers
that can direct the delivery of PRR ligands to specific immune compartments
using stimulus-responsive chemistry, biodegradable functional groups,
or targeting ligands. We then discuss how increased understanding
of immune receptor signaling, machine learning, and computation-guided
design, high-throughput synthesis and screening, and other strategies
will allow for the design of materials with a higher capacity for
PRR binding and adjuvanticity. Finally, we note the importance of
biocompatibility screening in the development of polymeric adjuvants
and propose methods by which this can be achieved.

While the immune
system cannot be fully covered in a single Perspective,
we provide a brief overview of some major components of innate and
adaptive immunity relevant for the design of immunostimulatory polymers
and their applications for vaccination and immunotherapy (Figure 1). More information
about specific aspects of immunity necessary in the design of next-generation
therapeutics can be found in excellent texts and reviews.26−30

Schematic
overview of relevant components of the innate and adaptive
immune systems for vaccination and cancer immunotherapy. Under a disruption
of homeostasis, antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the innate immune
system identify “non-self” and “damaged-self”
molecular motifs (PAMPs and DAMPs) through their major histocompatibility
complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II) and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
APCs then become activated, secrete immunostimulatory cytokines, and
present antigens on MHC-I or MHC-II to stimulate a response by the
adaptive immune system. The adaptive response is coordinated by B
cells, which bind antigens with their B cell receptor (BCR), as well
as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which bind peptide:MHC
complexes with their T cell receptor (TCR). Together, T and B cells
facilitate the destruction of the pathogen. Created with BioRender.com.

To protect the body from disease, foreign antigens
(any proteins
or carbohydrates to which an immune response is mounted) must be identified
by the immune system with the appropriate costimulatory molecules
to generate an immune response. Antigen presenting cells (APCs), such
as dendritic cells and macrophages, sample circulating proteins as
they pass through secondary lymphoid organs. These notably include
the lymph nodes, where APCs sample contents of the lymph draining
from peripheral tissues, and in the spleen, where APCs sample contents
of the blood. Under homeostatic conditions, APCs endocytose protein
antigens and enzymatically process them into short peptides (epitopes),
which can be loaded onto major histocompatibility complex I or II
(MHC-I and MHC-II). APCs then present these epitopes on MHC-I or MHC-II
to naïve T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. In the absence
of costimulatory molecules (i.e., in the case of an endogenous or
“self” antigen), such antigen presentation fails to
induce a productive immune response and results in anergy, exhaustion,
or immune regulation (i.e., T cell differentiation toward a regulatory
phenotype). During a disruption to homeostasis, such as the presence
of an infection or cancer (i.e., presence of “non-self”
or “damaged self”), APCs are further stimulated by pathogen
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and/or damage associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs) binding to PRRs in the cytosol or on the APC surface.
Activation of these PRRs can induce production of costimulatory factors,
such as cytokines (which are immune signaling proteins), which are
needed to license naïve T cells to become activated, rapidly
proliferate, and facilitate a memory-inducing adaptive immune response.
APCs also reside in lesser numbers in peripheral tissues, such as
the skin, and sample the local environment for antigens. Under stimulation
by PAMPs or DAMPs, they migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs where
they can similarly initiate an adaptive response.

The adaptive
component of the immune response is mediated by T
cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell-bound immunoglobulins (the B cell
receptor, BCR). TCRs, in coordination with CD4 and CD8, bind antigenic
epitopes presented by APCs on MHC-II or MHC-I, respectively, to bridge
innate and adaptive immunity. T cell responses can be separated into
a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, critical
for killing and clearing pathogen-infected or tumor cells, or a CD4+ “helper” T cell (Th) response, important for
secreting soluble immune mediators, such as cytokines, which enhance
CD8+ T cell and B cell responses. Helper T cells can be
further separated into Th1 and Th2 subtypes, where Th1 responses support
CTL-mediated killing and Th2 responses support B cell maturation and
differentiation. BCRs, meanwhile, bind antigenic macromolecules such
as proteins and carbohydrates (or, in some cases, synthetic materials)
on account of their secondary structure. Naïve B cells that
bind an antigen and subsequently receive stimulation by Th2-biasing
cytokines differentiate into plasma cells that can both secrete antibodies
and allow for phagocytosis to mediate destruction of pathogens. Alternatively,
arrayed binding of a repeating secondary structure, such as in the
case of a carbohydrate or synthetic material, can induce B cell maturation
and antibody production independent of T cell signaling. Stimulation
of B cells with appropriate cytokines can induce isotype class switching
from conventional IgM and IgD antibodies to those with increased affinity
and specialized functions, such as IgG2 (which specialize in responding
to bacterial capsular polysaccharides) and IgA (which specialize in
responding to mucosal infections).31 Concurrent
B and T cell responses are often necessary to neutralize pathogens.

Given the importance of innate immune costimulation in mounting
a productive adaptive immune response, providing PAMPs and/or DAMPs
that can bind PRRs concurrently with administration of antigen is
often necessary for application in vaccination and immunotherapy.28,29 Such molecular agonists and other molecules, which modulate adaptive
responses, are called adjuvants. While prophylactic vaccines were
historically generated from attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which
intrinsically contain PAMPs, new systems such as subunit and mRNA
vaccines or cancer immunotherapies may lack natural immunostimulatory
components and can require supplementation with adjuvants to facilitate
immunogenicity. There are >20 known PRRs that bind a diverse range
of molecular patterns, and the design of synthetic PRR agonists that
induce specific cytokine profiles for use in therapeutics is an active
area of research (Table 1). Despite promising research in these areas, synthetic adjuvants
are often limited by systemic toxicity, as activation of PRRs can
result in immunotoxic cytokine production and lead to fever, injection
site pain, or other side effects. In severe cases, excessive PRR stimulation
can result in a life-threatening pathology known as a “cytokine
storm” (sometimes called Cytokine Release Syndrome, or CRS).32,33 As such, effective formulation of antigen and adjuvant in a delivery
vehicle, such as synthetic nanoparticles, emulsions, or liposomes,
to target immune cell subsets and reduce adjuvant dose is often beneficial
for successful vaccine design. Alternatively, adjuvants that enhance
adaptive immunity through less-specific mechanisms than PRR binding
(such as general inflammation or “depot” effects) have
found success in clinical applications. Specifically, aluminum salts
(“alum”) were among the first adjuvants, and many FDA-approved
vaccines have made use of alum or squalene emulsion-based antigen
depots. The mechanism of antigen depot-based vaccines is debated but
appears to invoke B and T-helper cell-mediated immunity by stabilizing
antigen at the injection site, altering cell adhesion, and inducing
inflammation so as to recruit and activate nearby peripheral tissue-resident
APCs.33−35 While we will focus on adjuvants that target PRRs,
the ability of polymers to form biophysical interactions with cells
must be considered in defining the immunogenicity of next-generation
polymeric adjuvants.

Despite the promise of small molecule and biological
adjuvants
in preclinical studies, existing systems are limited by poor targeting
of immune cells and systemic toxicity, and few molecular adjuvants
have been approved by the FDA for prophylactic vaccination. Even among
recently FDA-approved molecular adjuvants, off-target toxicity has
proven to induce high grade immune-related adverse events in a significant
portion of the population and is thus likely to reduce vaccine compliance.33,36,39 Polymeric adjuvants developed
with careful early stage biocompatibility testing hold promise to
overcome these problems. These materials form nanostructures that
can mimic the size, shape, and biodistribution of pathogens, target
and deliver cargo selectively via the incorporation of immunogenic
molecular patterns, and slow the systemic release of immunostimulatory
components into the bloodstream. Moreover, by use of polymers that
can directly bind receptors while delivering antigenic cargo, systems
with multiple capacities for immunostimulation can be achieved. Understanding
the design principles needed to accomplish and control such responses
will facilitate the rational design of better therapeutics.

The innate immune
system has evolved to recognize PAMPs, molecular patterns unique to
pathogens, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, unmethylated CpG
DNA, and flagellin (Table 1). Researchers have utilized such pathogenic motifs in therapeutic
formulations to modulate innate immune responses and facilitate adaptive
immunity.4,40 Biologically derived polymers with adjuvant
capabilities can be extracted directly from biosources or synthesized
by chemical approaches. When used in vaccines and immunotherapies,
such polymers can facilitate antigen presentation, form depots, enhance
endocytosis, and bind PRRs to modulate the immune response.5 Moreover, repetitive carbohydrate polymer structures
can induce T cell-independent B cell responses.41,42 Carbohydrate-based formulations are employed in FDA-approved vaccines
against Hemophilius influenza type
B, Nisseria meningitidis, Salmonella typhi, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae and are known for inducing strong Th1-biased
responses.41 While this discussion will
focus primarily on carbohydrates, glycolipids, and their derivatives
as adjuvants, carbohydrates can also be employed as an antigen to
invoke potent B cell-mediated immunity; excellent reviews on carbohydrate
antigen vaccines can be found elsewhere.41,42

In the biological milieu, carbohydrates are ubiquitous as
soluble or insoluble structural and functional units in cells or as
glycosylation units bound to proteins called glycans.5 Carbohydrate-binding protein domains are known as lectins
and differentiated by their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD).
A wide array of polysaccharides have been shown in an immunological
context to engage the C-type lectin class of receptors and stimulate
innate immune responses.5,43 C-type lectins include
the mannose-binding lectins (which bind mannose-, fucose-, and N-acetylglucosamine-terminated glycans), Dectin-1 (which
binds β-glucan), DC-SIGN (which binds high-mannose glycans),
and many others, although significant overlap exists in terms of CRD
and lectin binding specificity.44 Carbohydrate
adjuvants targeting C-type lectins offer a promising alternative to
classical adjuvants, as they are potent, synthetically tunable, and
low-toxicity immune modulators. Here, we will focus on biologically
derived molecular targets of C-type lectins including mannose, fucose,
β-glucan, and chitosan. Other lectins, such as galectins (which
bind glycans containing N-acetyllactosamine) and
Siglecs (which bind glycans containing sialic acid), have also been
shown to play a role in innate immunity and have been reviewed elsewhere.45,46 In addition, glycolipids derived from diverse natural products can
produce robust immunological activity through PRRs or other innate
immune signaling molecules including TLR4, NLRP3, and CD1d. Perhaps
the most notable glycolipid is bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which
was one of the earliest identified PAMPs and has been extensively
reviewed for both its role in diseases and its use as an adjuvant.6,47 Here, we will focus on two relevant glycolipids, saponins and α-galactosylceramides
(α-GalCers), as they both have recently attracted attention
as adjuvants that can generate safe innate immune stimulation with
unique adaptive immune response profiles.

C-type lectins
with CRDs containing the amino acid sequence GluProAsn can bind mannose,
fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).44,48 These lectins can be further differentiated into soluble receptors,
which bind bacterial carbohydrates and signal for their destruction
via the complement pathway, and cell surface receptors, which can
facilitate endocytosis of antigen upon binding.48 We focus here on the cell surface receptors, of which DEC-205
(CD205), DC-SIGN (CD209), and the macrophage mannose receptors (MMR,
or CD206) are the most studied. Mannose is a C2 glucose epimer which
enzymatically reacts to form oligomers (glycosylations) at reactive
sites on the surface of many proteins.49 Naturally or synthetically mannosylated antigens that are capable
of binding these receptors enhance targeting and activation of antigen-presenting
cells to facilitate adaptive immunity when used in vaccines and immunotherapies.
Early works targeting the MMR identified the immunomodulatory capacity
of this approach, as work by Tan and colleagues demonstrate that mannosylated
antigens were more efficiently taken up by dendritic cells and presented
on MHC-II than nonmannosylated antigens.50 Despite the promise of naturally mannosylated antigens for vaccine
formulation, expression of glycosylated antigens in yeast or mammalian
cells remains challenging in many cases, posing a roadblock for broad
application of these systems and driving the development of synthetic
mannose alternatives for therapeutic application. Synthetic alternatives
have also been explored51−53 and are covered in greater detail
in Section 5.3.

The α(1→3) linked 6-deoxygalactose sugar, fucose, can
also function as a unique immunostimulatory component and holds potential
for cancer immunotherapy. Fucose-rich glycans are associated with
various cancers and can serve as an epitope for antibody-mediated
destruction in parallel with activation of cell surface C-type lectins.41 In work by Liao et al.,54 fucose-containing polysaccharides were isolated from Reishi mushrooms
and administered as an immunotherapy against a fucose-expressing Lewis
lung carcinoma. The isolates were shown to elicit antibody-dependent
cytotoxicity against the tumor. IgM antibody binding was probed by
using a glycan microarray and revealed high affinity for terminal
fucosylations reminiscent of known tumor-associated glycans. Ultimately,
the group showed an increase in B cell proliferation and slowed tumor
progression when mice were treated with a fucose-enriched Reishi polysaccharide
fraction to account for the observed responses.54 Though a novel approach to immunotherapy, fucose has not
been shown to induce T cell-mediated adaptive responses and likely
requires combination with conventional T cell directed immunotherapies
(such as checkpoint blockade) to induce productive antitumor responses
in a clinical setting.

β-glucans are
β1→3 and β1→6 linked glucose-based polysaccharides
found in fungal cell walls and recognized by a variety of immune receptors
including complement receptor 3 (CR3), Dectin-1 (CD369), and TLR2.
In particular, Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin with specificity for β-glucans
which, when bound, can induce a host of downstream immune responses
including NF-κB activation, phagocytosis, and induction of epigenetic
immune memory.55−58 Moreover, innate immune activation by Dectin-1 has been shown to
induce Th1 differentiation and elicit robust cellular immune responses.59 On account of their accessibility, desirable
immunogenic profile in the absence of toxicity, and ability to form
nanoparticles in solution, formulations comprising β-glucans
are desirable alternatives to conventional adjuvants and have shown
potential for vaccine formulations.55 In
an example highlighting the application of β-glucans for vaccination,
Donadei et al. show that soluble β1→3 linked glucans
conjugated to diptheria toxin induce robust antibody responses when
administered intradermally.60 The key benefit
to this system is that it allows targeting of skin-resident dendritic
cells without forming granulomas, which are seen when depot adjuvants
such as alum are administered intradermally or subcutaneously (alum
must be used intramuscularly as a result of this effect). Alternatively,
insoluble β-glucan particles can form antigen depots with greater
immunogenic capacity than alum, as shown recently in work by Soares
and co-workers using Curdlan β-glucan particles (GPs).61 In this study, a variety of carbohydrate-based
GP formulations including Curdlan, Curdlan with chitosan, and chitosan
(see Section 3.4)
were formulated as nanoparticulate delivery vehicles for hepatitis
B surface antigen (HBsAg). It was found that Curdlan GPs formulated
without chitosan were best internalized. When employed in a vaccine
formulation with HBsAg, the Curdlan GPs induced significant antibody
titers and Th1-associated cytokines, suggesting that particulate formulation
and Dectin-1 binding can facilitate antiviral immune responses and
that β-glucans and chitosan do not synergize for immunotherapy
(Figure 2). These results
and others62−65 highlight the potential of β-glucans as adjuvants for vaccines
and cancer immunotherapies. The development of facile syntheses or
isolations of precisely defined β-glucan scaffolds with optimized
solubility and pharmacokinetics remains a roadblock for clinical translation
and an area for future exploration by polymer chemists.

surface antigen (HBsAg) and chitosan (ChiP), β-glucan derived
from Curdlan (GP), or a blend of chitosan and β-glucan (ChiGluP).

formulations. (C) Antibody titers of mice. Mice were vaccinated with

titers were evaluated at day 42. Mice were then sacrificed at day

for 48 h; then supernatant was assayed for (D) Th1-biasing cytokines
and (E) Th2-biasing cytokines. Reproduced with permission from ref (61).

Chitosan is a positively
charged, β1→4 glucosamine-based polysaccharide derived
from chitin, a biopolymer that affords structural rigidity in a variety
of plants, animals, and fungi. Chitosan drives dendritic cell maturation
and induce Type 1 interferon (IFN) responses through a variety of
innate immune receptors.66−68 Perhaps most notably, a seminal
report by Carroll and co-workers68 demonstrates
that chitosan can activate the STING (stimulator of interferon genes)
pathway (see Section 4.2) to trigger APC maturation, costimulatory molecule expression,
and Th1-biased adaptive responses. Specifically, chitosan exposure
results in mitochondrial stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol.
Ultimately, activation of the STING pathway leads to Type 1 IFN production
and Th1-biased responses based on this elicited “danger”
signal.67,68 In addition to STING activation, chitosan
activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, binds various PRRs (including TLR2,
TLR4, and MMR), and can form antigen depots to mediate adjuvanticity.69−72 While this polyvalent mode of activation creates challenges for
mechanistic studies, translational works involving chitosan remain
an active area of research. In particular, various experiments have
shown that chitosan enhances the adjuvanticity of intranasal vaccines.73−75 On account of its positive charge, chitosan more effectively traverses
the mucosal membrane to deliver a given antigen and stimulate innate
immunity than conventional adjuvants. As a result, it is used both
in stand-alone formulations and as a component of nanoparticles to
enhance the efficacy of vaccines and other therapeutics.

Glycolipids
and saponins are an additional class of PAMPs composed of carbohydrate–lipid
conjugates that may be effective agents for use in next-generation
vaccine adjuvants.5,76 While the adjuvanticity of glycolipids
has been demonstrated to function through multiple classes of PRRs
(as discussed in excellent reviews5), here
we focus on saponin and α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)
systems that target new classes of receptors for immunomodulation.
Saponins are naturally occurring, amphiphilic, terpene-containing
oligosaccharides that have been used since the 1970s to facilitate
robust antigen uptake, balanced Th1/Th2 responses, and potent IgG
titers through multiple PRRs.37,77−80 Notably, saponin extracts are used in approved adjuvant formulations,
AS01B, AS01E, and Matrix-M, for respective vaccines
against shingles, malaria, and SARS-CoV-2.36,81−84 Work from den Brok and co-workers demonstrates one mechanism by
which saponin-based adjuvants function.85 The authors show that saponin-based adjuvanticity is based on lipid
body formation in dendritic cells which enhanced cross-presentation
to CD8+ T cells via the immunoproteasome. This result supports
the use of saponin-based adjuvants in cancer vaccines where CD8+ T cell responses are highly desirable. In other mechanistic
studies by Marty-Roix et al. and Welsby et al., saponin adjuvants
were found to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (see Section 4.3) via lysosomal rupture
in a cathepsin B- and MyD88-dependent manner.86,87 While the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in supporting adaptive
immunity is debated,88−90 release of proteolytic enzymes and lysosomal contents
into the cytosol supports the use of saponin adjuvants to enhance
cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells in adjuvant formulations.
Key limitations in the use of saponin adjuvants are their systemic
toxicity, complex bioavailability, and limited abundance in nature.91 These limitations motivate the development of
novel, synthetic glycolipid polymer adjuvants that target the NLRP3
inflammasome.

In contrast to saponins, α-GalCer adjuvants
are easily synthesized glycolipids which are also found in nature
as a structural component of the marine sponge, Agelas
mauritianus. α-GalCer has been shown to target
the CD1d receptor on APCs to facilitate activation of invariant natural
killer T cells (iNKT cells), which are a subset of T cells that bridge
innate and adaptive immunity by providing rapid T-helper cytokine
production (such as IFN-γ) without requiring a classical peptide
antigen. While early works using α-GalCer were plagued by low
binding affinity to CD1d, a screen of synthetic α-GalCer derivatives
was recently conducted, and an analogue, 7DW8-5, with increased affinity
was identified for use in vaccine and immunotherapeutic applications.92 Building upon this work, Feng and co-workers93 tested the efficacy of 7DW8-5 relative to a
conventional adjuvant, alum, when formulated in a commercially available
influenza H5N1 quadrivalent vaccine. The authors found that the 7DW8-5-containing
vaccine induced antibody titers that were comparable to the conventional
alum-based adjuvant but conferred improved survival after a lethal
H5N1 challenge.93 Importantly, these results
are backed by mechanistic studies demonstrating potent Th1- and Th2-mediated
responses due to the activation of iNKT cells.94 Facilitating iNKT cell proliferation using α-GalCer
and other CD1d ligands is a new and exciting avenue for vaccines and
immunotherapies, and engineering newer and more sophisticated formulations
to target CD1d in synergy with other innate immune receptors could
result in new and better therapeutics with desired and controlled
immune response profiles.

The prevailing
theory of pattern recognition supposes that the immune system responds
to pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns.6 While synthetic polymers (such as (meth)acrylamides and
(meth)acrylates) have not been designed with the expressed goals of
activating such systems, recent studies have highlighted that polymer
coils retain physicochemical properties and/or structural motifs that
can allow them to behave as danger signals and activate PRRs to induce
an immune response. As PRR ligation is better understood at the molecular
level and polymers of increasing complexity can be facilely prepared,
rational design could be employed to prepare polymers that disrupt
organelle homeostasis,95 interact with
biological receptors,96 and induce innate
immunostimulatory activity in a controlled manner. If achieved, synthetic
(i.e., nonbiologically derived or inspired) polymers that bind endogenous
PRRs (or otherwise activate innate immunity) would be advantageous
over conventional PRR agonists on account of their relative low cost,
high tunability, and facile compatibility with existing vaccine or
immunotherapy formulations, making immunostimulatory polymers desirable
for clinical translation. Likewise, given the broad domain space of
polymer synthesis and the breadth of materials currently in preclinical
testing, developing strategies to predict and test the immunostimulatory
capacity of synthetic polymers for nonimmunostimulatory applications
(such as drug delivery) is desirable for rapid and accurate early
stage screening of therapeutics.

Two PRRs that are amenable
to targeting by synthetic polymeric danger signals and which are highlighted
in this Perspective are the stimulator of interferon gene (STING)
and the NACHT-, LRR-, and PYD-domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3)
receptor systems. While other PRRs are targeted by highly specific
ligand–receptor systems, the STING and NLRP3 receptors are
unique in that they respond to broader classes of molecular signals.
As such, their activation can be induced by diverse stimuli and hold
high potential for activation by nonbiological polymers. Understanding
design principles for polymeric agonists of these receptors is critical
for the screening of nontoxic biomaterials and the design of next-generation
polymeric therapeutics.

STING is a PRR that is activated by cytosolic DNA to induce interferon
production.97 Similar to other innate immune
sensors, STING is activated via a two-step pathway. First, cyclic
guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (GMP-AMP) synthase
(cGAS) becomes activated upon binding DNA and catalyzes formation
of cyclic GMP-AMP dinucleotide (2′-3′ cGAMP). In turn,
2′-3′ cGAMP binds STING to induce a conformational change
and condense into a macromolecular aggregate, allow ligation with
TBK-1, and generate an interferon response.98−100 Other bacterial-derived
cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), such as cyclic di-GMP and di-AMP, can
similarly bind STING and serve a role in pathogen recognition and
are being explored as novel adjuvants.99 The development of STING agonist-based cancer vaccines is an active
area of research for several reasons: STING (1) is expressed in most
cell subsets, (2) is present in immunologically “cold”
(immune cell deficient) tumors, (3) is compatible with checkpoint
blockade therapies, and (4) can facilitate IFN-mediated CD8+ T cell responses which are critical for tumor destruction.101,102 Recently, synthetic non-nucleotide STING receptor agonists that
mimic the structure of CDNs have been prepared and shown to afford
robust antitumor activity, spurring multiple early stage clinical
trials probing safety and efficacy (NCT04144140, NCT03843359, NCT04609579,
and NCT04420884 at the time of submission).103−105 Given the unique mode of activation of STING, whereby a conformational
change of the protein structure induces its condensation, polymers
can be synthesized to target such changes and provide a novel therapeutic
modality for the treatment of disease.

While 2′-3′
cGAMP and its analogues have been the focus of most small molecule
STING agonist systems, recent work by the Gao laboratory has demonstrated
that a synthetic block copolymer, poly[(ethylene glycol)-b-(2-(hexamethyleneimino)ethyl methacrylate)] (PC7A), can bind
STING to induce downstream TBK-1 signaling and IFN production.96,106,107 By use of confocal microscopy,
site-directed mutagenesis, and binding assays, it was shown that PC7A
can access the cytosol and bind a noncompetitive site on both the
mouse and human STING proteins. PC7A can therefore be used in combination
with 2′-3′ cGAMP or other small molecule STING agonists
for dual STING-targeted therapy, and the polymer was demonstrated
to have robust efficacy for the treatment of multiple tumor models
(Figure 3). This system
is the first to our knowledge that employs a synthetic polymer to
bind an endogenous ligand in a mechanistic fashion. The polymeric
agonist has desirable properties when compared to synthetic STING
ligands. It is prepared in a single step from low-cost, commercially
available monomers, binds a noncompetitive STING surface site which
allows its use in 2′-3′ cGAMP-resistant STING variants,
forms nanoparticulate structures that facilitate enhanced cellular
uptake relative to small molecule agonists, and can be tuned by variation
of molecular weight or incorporation of dopant monomers. Additional
screening of other cyclic amine-based methacrylates by the Gao group
has shown that innate immune activation induced by PC7A is unique
to the seven-membered ring structure (Figure 3),106 highlighting
the specificity which will be required for future nonbiological polymeric
agonists.

A further consideration in the targeting of STING
for immunostimulatory
applications is that any cargo must be delivered to the cytosol of
target cells for effective therapy. Here, polymers can enhance stability
and delivery of STING ligands, thereby increasing immunogenicity for
their target application.108 Indeed, work
by Shae and colleagues109 exploits the
use of pH- and ROS-responsive endosomolytic polymersomes loaded with
2′-3′ cGAMP to target delivery of cargo to the tumor
microenvironment.109 By injecting the polymersomes
intratumorally or intravenously to mice carrying B16.F10 tumors, CD8+ T cell infiltration was enhanced 10-fold relative to 2′-3′
cGAMP alone. In combination with checkpoint blockade therapy, 4/10
mice treated intravenously with the polymersomes (but 0/10 treated
with 2′-3′ cGAMP alone) completely cleared the tumors.
In an alternative strategy, the negative charge of CDN STING agonists
was leveraged to allow charged-complexed, polyvalent delivery using
the Q11 peptide nanofiber platform. The Q11 nanofibers were functionalized
with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and a nona-arginine construct (PEG-Q11R9-CDN)
to facilitate endosomolysis and subsequent STING activation.110 Using the PEG-Q11R9-CDN complexes, they could
achieve selective delivery of the STING agonists to dendritic cells
and subsequent activation in mice using a sublingual route of administration.
Such advanced applications are advantageous for the coadministration
of STING agonists with other PRRs to generate synergistic activation
by a single construct.6,111 Similar strategies for the (co)delivery
of STING agonists have been employed by others,112−116 and more advanced formulations are expected to emerge as the STING
receptor is better understood.

In contrast to STING, whose native ligands are specific to nucleotide
agonists, the NLRP3 protein undergoes conformational change in response
to a broader class of stimuli that behave as danger signals (DAMPs)
after disruptions of homeostasis.117 While
diverse stimuli have been implicated in NLRP3 activation, including
reactive oxygen species,118−120 extracellular ATP,121 and lysosomal disruption,122−124 these stimuli likely converge on cellular potassium efflux as a
causative agent of the NLRP3 conformational change.117,125 Once activated, NLRP3 can interact with ASC, NEK7, and pro-Casp1
to form the NLRP3 inflammasome, a megadalton protein complex with
a host of effector functions.117,126,127 Specifically, NLRP3 inflammasome formation catalyzes cleavage of
pro-Casp1 to Casp1. Active Casp1 then facilitates secretion of IL-1β
and IL-18 and pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death characterized
by GSDMD N-terminal cleavage, cell membrane pore formation, and eventual
cell lysis.127,128 While the NLRP3 inflammasome
is implicated in pathologies including gout, Alzheimer’s disease,
and septic shock, it has also gained attention as a potent PRR for
use in novel vaccines and immunotherapies.88,89,117 Specifically, saponin adjuvants activate
the NLRP3 inflammasome via lysosomal disruption as described in Section 3.5 to induce potent
IL-1β signaling for initiation of an adaptive immune response.86,87 While effective, saponin-based systems are costly, derived from
limited natural resources, synthetically complex, and prone to toxicity.91 Synthetic polymer-based alternatives that activate
the NLRP3 inflammasome are desirable for use as adjuvants which overcome
these limitations and allow broad applicability of this technology.
Moreover, given the disease states and toxic side effects associated
with inflammasome activation, developing a molecular level understanding
of the physicochemical relationships between polymer–cell interactions,
lysosomal disruption, inflammasome activation, and toxicity will be
critical for the design of safe biomaterials.

Recently, it was
shown that cationic polymers can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via
endolysosomal disruption.124,129−133 Polymers are taken up by the cell and insert in the endosomal membrane
catalyzing its rupture upon endolysosomal acidification. The rupture
releases the lysosomal contents (including cathepsins) into the cytosol
and mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation.130,131 While the precise mechanism by which polymers disrupt the endolysosome
to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome is incompletely understood, we
and others have shown that the properties of polymers can modulate
the extent of lysosomal rupture and provide an avenue through which
controlled NLRP3 inflammasome activation can be achieved.130−133 Moreover, such lysosome-disrupting polymeric adjuvants can be formulated
to deliver immunostimulatory cargo to the cytosol and activate cytosolic
PRRs (such as STING) to afford multiadjuvant synergies. In a recent
publication by the Esser-Kahn group, the composition of a dendrimeric
scaffold composed of variable ratios of cationic amino acid and tetra(ethylene
glycol) (TEG) domains was found to modulate the extent of osmotic
swelling in the endolysosome following cellular uptake, thereby controlling
the extent of rupture and the degree of downstream Casp1 and IL-1β
activity (Figure 4A).130 Likewise, Baljon et al. report that the ratio
of butyl methacrylate to 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate in a
pH-responsive copolymer could tune the extent of endolysosomal rupture
and inflammasome activation in THP-1 cells,132 and Nandi et al. report that the alkyl content in poly[(ethylene
glycol)-b-[(coumarin methacrylate)-r-(octyl methacrylate)] similarly influenced the extent of endolysosomal
rupture and inflammasome activation in iBMDM cells (Figure 4B).131 These results highlight that subtle changes in physicochemical properties
can have drastic impacts on endolysosomal rupture and provide rapid,
high-throughput methods for the screening of NLRP3 inflammasome activation
via IL-1β activity. Such screening is critical for the design
of novel adjuvants and of polymeric biomaterial and drug delivery
formulations. Future work must be conducted to generate in
vivo correlates of these in vitro results
to confirm translation to higher order systems.

Beyond this in vitro mechanistic
work, synthetic
NLRP3 inflammasome activating adjuvant constructs have been engineered
to produce potent adaptive immune responses in vivo.111,134−136 Li et al.135 prepared poly(ethylenimine)-coated mesoporous
silica rods complexed with CpG (a TLR9 agonist) and the APC maturation-
and differentiation-supporting cytokine, GM-CSF. This formulation
was found to generate significant innate immune activation marked
by IL-1β secretion and induce antitumor immunity against multiple
tumor lines in only a single dose.135 Providing
a more mechanistic approach, the Takeoka group employed inflammasome-activating,
arginine-containing liposomes loaded with a model antigen, ovalbumin
(OVA), to probe antigen presentation and T cell activation.133 Here, it was shown that the ratio of cationic
arginine groups to hydrophobic lipid tail influenced the extent of
cellular uptake, endolysosomal rupture, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
The liposomes which maximally rupture lysosomes were found to induce
upregulation of cell surface activation markers, CD40 and CD86, and
route antigens for presentation on MHC-I to facilitate a CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response.133 Other works
have highlighted that IL-1β and IL-18 can synergize with IL-12
to invoke potent antitumor responses, providing an additional framework
by which rationally designed adjuvant formulations based on inflammasome
activation can be achieved.137,138 These works highlight
the potential of inflammasome activation as a mediator of adaptive
immunity, but future work must be conducted to better elucidate how
polymer physicochemical properties and related inflammasome activation
correlate with the in vivo response.88−90 Such structure–bioactivity relationships will allow the rational
design of polymers for vaccines and immunotherapy.

Polymer–drug
systems have gained attention as a method by which enhanced immunostimulatory
activity can be achieved. Polymers covalently conjugated to or noncovalently
assembled with immunogenic groups such as PRR agonists can allow for
polyvalent receptor–ligand interactions, localized delivery
of cargo, or delivery of multiple cargoes to a single locus. In immunology,
such constructs have been employed in the design of novel adjuvants,
which can concurrently deliver antigenic cargo and activate one or
more PRRs for vaccination or cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, it
has been shown that physicochemical properties play a dramatic role
in the resultant immunological activity of PRR–adjuvant conjugates
or assemblies in vivo. This was demonstrated in a
notable work by Lynn and Laga et al.7 where
R848, a TLR7/8 agonist, was conjugated to an N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide
scaffold via a thiazolidine-2-thione reactive moiety and used as a
vaccine adjuvant in nonhuman primates (Figure 5). In that work, nanoparticle formation,
agonist density, and charge were all critical in mediating immunogenicity,
providing a framework by which efficacious PRR agonist–polymer
conjugates can be prepared.7 Given these
results, we highlight physicochemical properties that can enhance
or otherwise affect immune activity on account of the polymer backbone
and then describe some covalent and noncovalent strategies that have
been employed to generate highly immunogenic polymer–drug systems.
While PRR agonist–polymer conjugates have been discussed previously
because of their ability to facilitate immune synergies,6,111,139,140 we focus herein on the role of polymer properties and synthetic
design in the innate activity of polymer–PRR agonist systems.
Moreover, while not discussed herein, we note the critical importance
of linker chemistry and degradation kinetics in the design of polymer–drug
conjugate systems and direct the reader to excellent reviews on this
topic.141,142

The physicochemical properties of immunogenic cargo
play a key role in their resulting immunostimulatory activity and
bioavailability.143 Particle size can control
routing of molecular cargo to the immune system; larger particles
(>500 nm) form antigen depots at the injection site for processing
by tissue-resident APCs, while smaller particles (<100 nm) quickly
and directly drain to the lymph node and afford efficient presentation
by lymph node-resident APCs.144,145 Unformulated soluble
cargo (<10 nm), meanwhile, rapidly enters the bloodstream where
it can induce off-target systemic side effects before being removed
by the liver and/or kidneys.8 While the
favorable pharmacokinetics of particulate systems are beneficial relative
to those of soluble systems for the controlled delivery of adjuvants,
both injection site- and lymph node-targeting strategies have found
use in FDA-approved vaccines. This highlights the divergent strategies
which can be employed in different contexts to develop a productive
immune response.37,146 Despite the advantages of particulate
systems, controlling size and precise physicochemical properties of
such systems remains challenging and is further limited by poor encapsulation
efficiency of chemically incompatible cargo (such as hydrophobic adjuvants).
Next-generation polymeric vaccine systems will afford better control
over the size of formulated materials and compatibility of materials
incorporated therein to enhance stability and efficacy of the end-product.

Even among similarly sized nanoparticles, shape, charge, and texture
can further modulate immune responses. The Mitragotri group and others
have shown that particle shape plays a distinct role in phagocytosis
and processing of antigen, with smaller, spherical particles (mimicking
that of many natural pathogens) exhibiting maximum phagocytosis by
APCs. In contrast, higher aspect ratio materials induce poor cellular
uptake and cellular damage consistent with NLRP3 inflammasome activation
and/or necrotic cell death.147−150 Charge can similarly modulate activity of
polymer-containing immunogenic systems. Cationic polymers such as
poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) (AEMA),
poly(N,N′-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate) (DMAEMA), and polyarginine have been employed to complex
negatively charged PRR agonists such as CpG (TLR9 agonist) or poly(I:C)
(TLR3 agonist) and enhance uptake and cytosolic delivery.110,112,135,151 Such cationic polymers can effectively facilitate cytosolic delivery
to enhance cross-presentation of antigen on MHC-I or to deliver mRNA
and DNA for vaccination or gene therapy.152−154 While promising, cationic polymers often suffer from immunotoxic
side effects on account of their ability to disrupt cellular or endolysosomal
membranes, and further understanding of the relationship between physicochemical
properties, immunogenicity, and toxicity of these materials in biological
settings remains an active area of research.153,155−158 Lastly, the Kurt-Jones group has shown that particle texture can
alter immune responses, with rough polystyrene nanoparticles inducing
greater immunostimulatory activity and neutrophil infiltration than
smooth particles.159 Collectively, these
results highlight the many parameters which can be modulated in the
design of an optimal immunotherapeutic agent.

Covalently linked combinations of
synthetic polymers and additional immunostimulatory components are
attractive for the design of adjuvants with precise molecular composition
and behavior in solution. Several of the most attractive strategies
for the design of covalent systems include linear polymers with PRR
agonist grafts, dendrimers, functionalized solid nanoparticles (such
as gold, silica, or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)),
cross-linked hydrogels, and mechanically interlocked polymers (Figure 6A).2 The Hubbell group has demonstrated one application of polymer–drug
conjugates to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.51 In this work, a TLR7 agonist-containing methacrylamide
monomer based on the imidazoquinolinone class (pTLR7) and a mannose-containing
methacrylamide monomer (pMan) were polymerized by using RAFT to obtain
p(Man-s-TLR7). This polymer was conjugated to a model
antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), by using a self-immolative disulfide-based
linker to form an antigen-docked synthetic scaffold for immune activation
(Figure 7).51In vitro, this platform show
improved uptake and presentation of antigen using BMDC and T cell
coculture experiments, and competition experiments using anti-CD206
and anti-CD209 antibodies (which block MMR and DC-SIGN, respectively)
reveal that synthetic mannosylation was responsible for this response.
After demonstrating the efficacy of this model by using OVA, p(Man-s-TLR7) was conjugated to the malaria circumsporozoite protein
(CSP) and used in a murine vaccination study. Here, p(Man-s-TLR7) conjugated to CSP was shown to induce improved antigen
specific T and B cell responses relative to unlinked controls. The
Hubbell group has demonstrated in other works that this synthetic
glycosylation strategy can be similarly employed by using GalNac and
GlcNac as glycans to route antigens to the liver and induce tolerance
in a model of diabetes.52 Glycans prepared
by using the polymerizable monomer approach serve as an exciting area
of exploration, and we await application for treatment of diverse
disease states.

Beyond linear polymer scaffolds, dendrimers, functionalized
nanoparticles,
and cross-linked hydrogels can allow for higher density display of
antigen or ligand as well-defined (and potentially stimulus-responsive)
nanocarriers. Specifically, dendrimers can improve solubility and
biocompatibility while displaying adjuvants at their surface on account
of their globular structure.160−163 Wang and colleagues recently reported a
light-responsive adjuvant therapy based on a TLR7-activating 2-aminoimidazole
derivative and a poly(lysine) dendron. When complexed with an anticancer
agent and antigen, dendrimeric light- and hypoxia-responsive nanoassemblies
are formed which were found to display robust anticancer therapy against
multiple tumor models.164 Cationic PAMAM-based
systems have also been extensively employed for gene therapies and
cancer therapeutics, but their toxic side effects have limited use
in other applications such as vaccination or drug delivery.158,165 Similarly, polymeric or inorganic nanoparticles can be functionalized
with PRR agonists to afford polyvalent display and reduce systemic
side effects relative to soluble ligands. Such materials been extensively
reviewed elsewhere with the chief limitation of this approach being
that many solid materials are poorly biocompatible and biodegradable.2,3,25 Chemically cross-linked hydrogels,
meanwhile, show great potential for generating immunogenic adjuvant
systems with tailored physicochemical properties, biocompatibility,
and release of synthetic or biologically derived cargoes.166−172 Demonstrating the potential of this synthetic approach, the Irvine
lab has developed protein nanogel “backpacks”, which
can be tethered to CAR T cells (engineered T cells with a scFv acting
as a TCR) to support proliferation after adoptive cell transfer therapy.167 The backpacks contain recombinant IL-15, which
supports T cells proliferation, and CD45, which serves as an anchor
to the T cell surface, and are cross-linked at lysine residues by
using a disulfide-containing NHS-ester linker.167 The backpacks were found to enhance T cell proliferation
16-fold relative to CAR T cells delivered with soluble IL-15, and
this technology is now in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment
of solid tumors (NCT03815682). While reversible bonds have found use
in both chemistry and biology during the past decade, better strategies
for the stimulus-responsive release of cross-linked biologicals under
specific conditions will allow targeting of various immune cell subsets.

Finally, mechanically interlocked materials (such as polyrotaxanes
and slide ring gels) can enhance avidity by allowing threaded ligands
to freely move along a linear polymer axis.173 While basic proofs of concept have been demonstrated by using this
approach,174−176 advances in the controlled synthesis of
interlocked materials173 now allow the
advantages of such materials to be realized for drug delivery and
immunostimulatory polymer applications.

Spontaneous self-assembly or
controlled nanoformulation of components using noncovalent strategies
is an alternative strategy to achieve immunogenic materials. The advantages
of such noncovalent strategies are that they are easily prepared from
low-cost starting materials, break down on biologically relevant time
scales into biocompatible byproducts, and can be imparted with stimuli
responsive or other desirable properties.167,177,178 Formulations including imiquimod
(a small molecule TLR7/8 agonist) serve as an example of the promise
of formulated nanomaterials; while systemic toxicity after injection
has prevented clinical translation of imiquimod as vaccine adjuvant,
a lipid-modified derivative, 3M-052, adsorbed onto alum has shown
remarkable safety and efficacy in preclinical studies and is now undergoing
early stage clinical trials for prophylactic influenza vaccination
when codelivered with antigen (NCT04177355).179−181 With these results in mind, we highlight the design of self-assembled
materials as well as disordered nanoaggregates (Figure 6B) that hold potential for immunological
applications.

Self-assembled delivery systems such as liposomes,
lipid nanoparticles, micelles, and polymersomes have gained significant
attention in the past decade. These systems are desirable because
of their spontaneous self-assembly, synthetic reproducibility, high
biocompatibility, quality of stabilizing reactive cargo, and ability
to release material on biologically relevant time scales. On account
of their amphiphilic properties, they also can encapsulate both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic cargoes, making them highly versatile for the delivery
of chemically diverse materials. While liposomes and lipid micelles
have been extensively reviewed for drug delivery,25,182 perhaps the most notable recent application of self-assembled lipid-based
nanocarriers for immunological applications has been in the delivery
of mRNA. Here, lipid nanoparticles have been FDA-approved for vaccination
against SARS-Cov-2 in 2021.183 In these
systems, the ionizable lipid nanocarrier stabilizes mRNA from degradation
and, upon endocytosis, assists in endosomal escape to deliver mRNA
to the cytosol.183,184 mRNA plays a dual role in encoding
for the production of antigen while also behaving as an adjuvant,
acting on multiple PRRs including TLR3, TLR7, and RIG-I to stimulate
a Th1-biased immune response.183,185 The lipid composition
plays an important but poorly understood role in the resultant immune
response and remains an active area of research.183 Alternative to lipid-based systems, polymersomes and polymeric
micelles can be prepared that allow greater synthetic control over
the molecular architecture and can confer stimuli-responsive behavior
to the delivery system. Demonstrating these advantages, Dowling and
Scott et al.186 synthesized a series of
poly(ethylene glycol-b-propylene sulfide) polymersome-based
vaccines loaded with a small-molecule TLR8 adjuvant and antigen. They
compare the effects of different polymersome size and antigen loads
on immunogenicity of the polymersome-based vaccines relative to live
attenuated Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine.186 Maximum innate and adaptive immune responses
are achieved with the polymersomes when size and antigen load are
matched to the properties of the live attenuated virus, providing
further design principles for next-generation therapies.

In
contrast to self-assembled systems, chemically irregular noncovalent
formulations can be achieved by nanoprecipitation or in situ hydrogel formation. Nanoprecipitation involves rapid transfer of
cargo from a good solvent (often methanol or dimethyl sulfoxide) to
a bad solvent (such as aqueous phosphate buffer) via dialysis or microfluidic
mixing. As an example of this strategy, the Esser-Kahn lab has synthesized
a poly(orthoester) scaffold which assembles by nanoprecipitation with
a heterodimeric TLR2/6 and TLR7 agonist and antigen.187 When the resultant ∼50 nm constructs are administered
as a cancer immunotherapy to mice bearing an aggressive B16.F10 melanoma,
complete remission of the tumor is achieved.187 This formulation furthermore reduced systemic side effects relative
to soluble TLR2/6 and TLR7 agonists, likely by prolonging bioavailability
relative to the soluble formulation.187,188 Nanoprecipitation
is a powerful approach to encapsulate large quantities of immunogenic
materials and deliver them to specific cell subsets; however, it is
limited by solvent compatibility of the cargo needed for successful
nanoaggregate formation. Alternatively, the solvent compatibility
requirement can be eliminated entirely by encapsulating cargo in hydrogels.
In a recent example applied to vaccine delivery, the Appel lab has
synthesized a polymer–nanoparticle hydrogel formulation composed
of dodecyl-modified hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (C12-HPMC) loaded
with PEG–PLA nanoparticles.189 This
system is desirable because it can be formulated with both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic cargo and injected through a syringe on account of
its shear thinning behavior. The hydrogels, when formulated with a
hydrophilic model protein antigen and a hydrophobic TLR3 agonist,
displayed a depot effect at the injection site for more than 1 week
and enhanced antibody responses 90 days after injection relative to
a soluble formulation in the absence of a booster dose. Such delayed
release formulations could enhance vaccine compliance and accessibility,
but tuning the formulation to control release kinetics over relevant
time scales remains challenging and an area of exploration.

While polymers
can enhance the adjuvanticity of immunostimulatory formulations as
described in Section 5, they must also release cargo to specific cell subsets in the absence
of immunotoxic side effects.2,190 To achieve this requirement,
polymer–drug formulations can be imparted with stimuli responsive
characteristics by using reversible chemistries or biodegradable linkages
to allow release of molecular cargo under specific cellular or subcellular
conditions, such as the reductive tumor microenvironment or acidic
endolysosome.
Alternatively, targeting ligands (often peptides that bind specific
receptors) can allow delivery to specific cell subsets. Here, we discuss
chemistry used in the design of several classes of responsive materials
for immunological applications: pH-responsive materials for endolysosomal
disruption, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive materials for
tumoral delivery, biodegradable polymers and peptides for slow release
of cargo, and thermally responsive materials for delivery to metabolically
active tissues. Furthermore, we discuss the incorporation of targeting
peptides into the polymer backbone for the delivery of molecular cargo
to specific cell subsets and/or organelles.

Various chemistries can be employed to prepare polymers that decompose
or undergo physicochemical change in response to endolysosomal acidification
to deliver cargo into the cytosol. Endolysosomes are cellular compartments
in APCs that contain proteolytic enzymes and maintain a pH of 4–6.
Upon APC activation, a decrease in endolysosomal pH can accelerate
proteolytic processing and invoke antigen presentation on MHC-I and/or
MHC-II. Such processing, in parallel with PRR signaling, is critical
for the initiation of an adaptive immune response, making the endolysosomes
of APCs attractive targets for the delivery of immunostimulatory cargo.
To do so, pH-responsive chemistry can be employed. Some examples of
responsive groups include (1) acetal- or hydrazone-based linkers that
break and alter polymer morphology upon cleavage,134,191 (2) amine-, carboxylate-, or imidazole-containing polymers that
undergo an acid/base transition at biologically relevant pKa values,109,116,132,153,157,192 and (3) reversible charge complexes
that decompose under particular conditions.193−195 For vaccine and cancer immunotherapy development, pH-responsive
materials can be combined with immunostimulatory ligands to create
nanostructures that can target endosomal or cytosolic immune receptors.
Highlighting a creative application of this strategy, Gong et al.
reported a pH-responsive copolymer that undergoes conformational change
from 100 nm spherical structures to 5–8 μm nanosheets
and delivers cargo upon endolysosomal acidification.134 These polymeric assemblies mechanically rupture the lysosome
to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and deliver antigen to the cytosol
to facilitate antigen presentation on MHC-I. This “nanotransformer”
vaccine was found to induce potent CD8+ T cell responses
and facilitate complete B16.F10 tumor regression in combination with
checkpoint blockade therapy in mice.134 These results highlight the interplay between polymer engineering
and immune recognition and inspires design principles for future polymer
adjuvant applications.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a byproduct of metabolically
active cells and are thus produced at high levels by rapidly proliferating
cancer cells in the tumor environment.196 Given the chemical reactivity of oxygen radicals with functional
groups (for example, in the reduction of disulfide/diselenide, arylboronic
ester, or aminoacrylate bonds), ROS production can serve as a selective
trigger for the degradation of polymers and/or the site-specific delivery
of cargo to the tumor microenvironment. Synthesis of ROS-responsive
polymers has been expertly reviewed.197 For cancer immunotherapy, such selective triggers can be used to
deliver otherwise toxic doses of immunogenic material to the tumor
site and facilitate otherwise inaccessible levels of cytotoxic T cell
infiltration. Liang et al. recently published112 an immunotherapeutic system composed of an anticancer agent,
SN38, functionalized with a reducible disulfide linker and a methacrylate
handle. The resultant SN38 monomer construct was incorporated within
a cationic triblock copolymer scaffold (poly(ethylene glycol-b-SN38 methacrylate-b-diethylaminoethyl
methacrylate)) and subsequently self-assembled with DMXAA, a small
molecule STING agonist specific to mice, to form 30 nm particles (pSN38-STING).
In the reductive tumor microenvironment, the disulfide bonds are cleaved,
and the pSN38-STING scaffold disassembles to trigger release of both
DMXAA and SN38. The pSN38-STING particles were used as a therapeutic
in a B16.F10 tumor model, where it was shown that they induced complete
regression of an aggressive melanoma when administered with checkpoint
blockade.112 As demonstrated in this work
and others, ROS-responsive nanoformulations are often combined with
anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4 checkpoint blockade or cytokine-based therapies
to further enhance T cell activity.112,167 Moreover,
delivery systems with combined ROS- and pH-responsive properties can
direct delivery of immunogenic cargo to antigen-presenting cells in
the tumor microenvironment.198−202 Such multi-stimuli-responsive systems offer the promise to be instrumental
in developing advanced therapeutics that afford clinical efficacy
without toxicity.

Thermally responsive, synthetic materials provide
a facile approach to drug encapsulation and release to metabolically
active sites (such as the site of an infection or the tumor microenvironment).
Polymers can exhibit either a lower or upper critical solution temperature
(LCST or UCST), at which point the solubility of material in its aqueous
environment is reversed.203,204 In LCST polymers,
warming past the critical temperature induces a hydrophilic to hydrophobic
transition. In this context, N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAAm) has been studied extensively due to its LCST in aqueous solution
(32 °C) near body temperature (37 °C). Early work by the
Discher group demonstrates the application of NIPAAm-based vesicles
for payload delivery upon application of a temperature stimulus.205 By designing amphiphilic diblock copolymers
composed of NIPAAm and ethylene glycol, these vesicles could self-assemble
and maintain their morphology upon injection. Applying a local cold
pack resulted in disruption of structure to deliver cargo at a target
site of interest. This technique is envisioned as a tool for chemotherapeutic
delivery of toxic agents selectively to tumors. In an alternative
strategy, Nishimura and co-workers probed the temperature-induced
release of macromolecular payloads from maltopentose-b-poly(propylene oxide) vesicles.206 Using
small-angle X-ray scattering and confocal microscopy, it was demonstrated
that the formed vesicles dissociated in a multistep fashion upon cooling
to 0 °C. It should be noted, however, that only ∼1–2%
loading efficiency was demonstrated for their macromolecular payloads.
Low loading efficiencies and poor control over the kinetics of payload
release have hindered application of these techniques, and better
synthetic strategies are needed for clinically relevant translation.

For effective clinical translation of polymer-based
drug delivery and adjuvant systems, the polymeric carrier must degrade
on a clinically relevant time scale or otherwise avoid immunotoxic
side reactivity and foreign body responses. To achieve this goal,
a common approach is to employ biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(hydroxybutyrate), poly(β-amino
esters), or naturally occurring carbohydrates, which are hydrolyzed
under biological conditions to naturally occurring small molecules.2,17,207−209 Such biodegradable systems are dually advantageous because, in addition
to their lower immunotoxicity, they can be designed to release their
payloads over kinetically controlled time scales. To this end, PLGA
nano- and microparticles have been extensively studied as slow-release
vaccine delivery systems.209 Such particles
can be synthesized with controlled size properties by using emulsion
polymerization to facilitate lymphatic delivery145 and simultaneously co-encapsulate small-molecule PRR agonists
and subunit antigens; more information regarding PLGA-based drug delivery
can be found in excellent reviews.209,210 In addition
to synthetic biodegradable polymers, peptide-based drug delivery can
be advantageous on account of their biocompatibility, high degree
of synthetic tunability, and ability to incorporate non-native functionalities.110,211−213 Peptides can be designed to prolong bioavailability
or rapidly degrade on account of their susceptibility to react with
endogenous proteases,214 and they can further
be employed to deliver cargo to specific (sub)cellular compartments
as described in Section 6.6. The toxicity or immunogenicity of peptide linkers can be
modulated by modifying amino acid composition, and screening can be
accelerated by recursive bio-based screening methods such as phage
display.211,215,216 For example, Kang and colleagues used phage display to identify
a nontoxic peptide that improves trafficking of macromolecules across
the intestinal mucosal barrier for oral drug delivery.216 One key limitation in the synthesis of peptide-based
systems is scalability relative to polymer synthesis or bacterial
protein expression, as solid-phase peptide synthesis is costly, requires
large quantities of toxic solvent, and is limited in the cases of
difficult amino acid sequences or self-assembled sequences.

Polymeric and nanoparticulate
delivery systems can be localized to specific (sub)cellular compartments
by using targeting ligands, most often peptides containing one or
more of many well-defined localization sequences.3,217−219 To design such targeting peptides, well-defined
chemistries that allow for materials with tailored physicochemical
properties (including molecular weight, dispersity, and nanostructure),
controlled peptide incorporation, and the ability to deliver additional
immunogenic moieties within a synthetic polymer scaffold must be developed.
The Gianneschi group has developed pioneering chemistries to achieve
these goals. In an earlier work, ring-opening metathesis polymerization
of peptide-functionalized norbornene-based monomers was used to synthesize
high-density peptide brush polymers.220,221 By use of
cell-penetrating peptides as a model system, it is shown that the
synthesized peptide–polymer conjugates can resist proteolysis
relative to unconjugated peptides and effectively deliver cargo to
the cytosol in the absence of toxicity. More recently, the same group
synthesized high-density peptide brush polymers using PET-RAFT polymerization
with acrylamide-modified peptides in water or DMSO.212,213 By extending the high-density peptide brush polymers with a second,
hydrophobic block, micellar nanoparticles that display the peptide
brushes on their surface could be generated. This strategy is advantageous
because it lacks postpolymerization modification or harsh conditions
which can introduce toxic contaminants or heterogeneity into the system.
Alternatively, polymers bearing amines, thiols, or alkynes can be
modified by using click chemistry to engraft targeting ligands which
may not survive radical polymerization.3 These approaches provide methods by which polymer–drug systems
can be used to deliver cargoes to (sub)cellular compartments, preventing
systemic toxicity while enhancing efficacy.

In
this Perspective, we outline current strategies for the preparation
of both biological and synthetic immunostimulatory polymers that target
a broad range of receptors including C-type lectins, Dectin-1, STING,
NLRP3, and TLRs. We then explore strategies, such as covalent or noncovalent
combinations of polymers and PRR agonists and responsive or targeted
delivery, to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccine and immunotherapeutic
formulations. Recent advances in living polymerization, polymer–drug
systems, and understanding of immunology have allowed encouraging
increases in the rate of development for new therapeutic strategies.
While drug delivery systems and responsive materials have been heavily
explored in the past decade, biologically derived and synthetic polymers
with innate immunostimulatory capacity have been unlocked by these
advances and now comprise a novel field ripe for exploration. We now
discuss areas that we find promising for the identification of new
immunostimulatory polymers and strategies for rapid, low-cost, and
effective biocompatibility screening.

While development
of polymers that target common innate immune receptors, such as TLRs,
has been well studied, there remains an opportunity to target novel
receptors that confer different and desirable immunologic responses.
Recent advances in carbohydrate chemistry offer exciting opportunities
to access novel polymers that target previously inaccessible lectins.
For example, the Bertozzi group recently reported a strategy where N-carboxyanhydride polymerization is employed to target
Dectin-1 or Siglec receptors.222,223 An advantage of such
synthetic strategies is that additional functionality can be built
into the polymeric agonists to develop materials that can target multiple
receptors or deliver various components. In addition to the promise
of biologically active carbohydrate-based polymers, recent advances
in immunology have identified new receptors that can be targeted for
immunotherapy. Notably, the DNGR-1 receptor (also called CLEC9A or
CD370) was recently found to bind F-actin–myosin and confer
cross-presentation of phagocytosed antigens on MHC-I to direct CD8+ T cell responses.224 Given the
polymeric fiber-like structure of F-actin–myosin and desirability
of CD8+ T cell-directed responses in cancer immunotherapy,
synthetic DNGR-1 agonists are an attractive area for future study.
Developing strategies to synthesize polymeric agonists of these receptors
and target appropriate cell subsets with specificity will result in
novel applications of biomaterials.

Beyond
targeting novel receptors, developing polymers with better binding
affinity and avidity or that can disrupt organelle homeostasis to
activate innate immunity is an attractive strategy for the design
of next-generation therapeutics. A growing body of work from the Esser-Kahn
lab and others130−132 indicates that small differences to polymer
physicochemical properties can have large impacts on immunostimulatory
activity of synthetic polymers targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. As
such, better methods for synthesis, characterization, and screening
of the immunostimulatory activity of polymers targeting both the NLRP3
inflammasome and other immune receptors will allow structure–bioactivity
relationships to be developed over a larger domain space. Advances
in high-throughput polymer synthesis make such screens possible.225−227 In a strategy pioneered by the Gormley group, polymer–drug
conjugates were synthesized in an oxygen tolerant, one-pot approach
using PET-RAFT in DMSO. Pendant cyclopropenone-protected cyclooctynes
were then functionalized with azide-modified peptides or ligands under
ambient conditions and purified via size exclusion chromatography
to generate libraries of ligand–polymer conjugates for screening
in 96- or 384-well format.227 This approach
is low cost as well as scalable and provides a high degree of synthetic
control in terms of monomer selection, polymer chemistry, and postpolymerization
modification. These characteristics make such approaches ideally suited
for translation. An example of the promise of high-throughput polymer
synthesis in drug candidate screening was recently reported by the
Appel lab, where a screen of 90 polymer-functionalized insulins was
used to develop an ultrafast-acting insulin formulation with greater
stability and efficacy in a porcine model of diabetes.228 Here, polymer composition was shown to alter
the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and activity, highlighting
the impact that polymer design can have on downstream applications.

In tandem
with high-throughput screening, machine learning and computational
prediction will further direct and accelerate the discovery of novel
polymers with desirable immunological properties. Machine learning
will allow emergent trends in functional polymers to emerge, as was
recently discussed by Gormley and Webb,229 while further computational strategies can be employed to model
polymeric interactions with biological target receptors such as PRRs
or cancer proteins. The discovery of a STING-activating polymer96,106,107 by the Gao laboratory highlights
the potential of synthetic immunostimulatory polymers (Figure 2), yet to unlock the full potential
of this approach, polymers that can better recapitulate the enormous
structural complexity of biological systems must be developed. To
achieve this goal, strategies applied from the prediction of protein
structure and ligand–receptor binding can be applied.230−232 Demonstrating mechanisms necessary to achieve this goal, work by
the Baker group has identified that computational prediction can be
employed to synthesize biopolymers that assemble in precise three-dimensional
topologies,233−236 and such strategies were used to generate a peptide vaccine that
mimics the structure of natural virus to afford potent B and T cell
responses in a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) model.236 Iterative strategies combining machine learning
and high-throughput screening (i.e., machine-learning-guided directed
evolution)237,238 can be used to direct discovery
of polymers that can bind innate immune receptors or achieve well-controlled
adaptive immune responses. Achieving analogous structural complexity
in synthetic polymer scaffolds and directing assembly to form structures
that can bind with immune receptors is an exciting frontier which
is on the forefront of possibility in the next decade.

As noted throughout this Perspective, the relationship
between biomaterial efficacy and toxicity is inextricably linked.
Many of the properties such as protein–polymer interactions,
membrane disruption, or reversible chemistries that can make polymeric
materials effective as adjuvants can also induce cell necrosis, complement
activation, and toxic tissue accumulation in different contexts.190 Moreover, the repetitive structure of polymers,
especially PEG-based drug delivery systems, have been shown to induce
antipolymer antibodies, resulting in rapid clearance of biologically
active cargo and undesired hypersensitivity reactions.239 Given this double-edged sword of efficacy and
toxicity, developing rapid, translatable, and consistent methods to
screen the immunological activity of polymeric materials at the preclinical
development stage is critical to avoid costly translational research
of toxic biomaterials. Currently, a lack of streamlined characterization
tools has led to a scattershot of poorly defined in vitro and in vivo assays and has hindered progress in
this domain. As such, in the screening of new materials for immunomodulatory
and biomedical applications, we propose a series of simple and inexpensive in vitro experiments that can rapidly provide immunological
information about novel immunomodulatory polymers. Such experiments
were developed in the Esser-Kahn group for screening polymeric drug
delivery systems and have proven broadly effective in rapidly predicting
the in vivo safety and efficacy of broad classes
of water-soluble or -dispersible polymeric materials (Figure 8).240−243

Proposed
strategy for the low-cost and high-throughput screening
and optimization of biomaterials for immunogenic and drug delivery
applications.

To test the immunological activity of polymeric
materials, it must
first be confirmed that the materials are free of endotoxin contamination
derived from the synthesis or purification process. While the gel
clot Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay is the
most common test for endotoxin contamination, this test relies on
clotting of the coagulogen protein upon binding of endotoxins. As
polymers often induce nonspecific clotting upon interaction with coagulogen,
alternative tests are preferred.243,244 We have found
that incubating polymers with the HEK TLR4 reporter cell line can
provide a rapid and accurate readout of endotoxin contamination. In
the case of endotoxin contamination, depyrogenation (i.e., removing
endotoxin) can be achieved by heating, acid treatment, or extraction
of endotoxic contaminants to achieve “clean” materials
for preliminary testing.244 After endotoxin
removal, in vitro immunostimulatory capacity can
be assayed to determine the use case for polymers of interest. While
several assays for immunological compatibility are employed in the
literature, we and others have found cellular toxicity, NF-κB
and IFN signal transduction pathway activation, and IL-1β secretion
serve as useful predictors for polymeric materials.240,241,243,245 NF-κB and IFN gene expression are critical markers of early
innate immune activation and, by using genetically encoded reporter
cell lines, can serve as a low-cost alternative to multiplexed cytokine
panels.6,246,247 IL-1β
secretion and toxicity provide further information about immunotoxic
cell death and can be rapidly assayed in vitro by
quantifying secreted analytes with colorimetric assays such as ELISA.
These tests can be conducted in both secondary and primary cells,
although lack of reporter genes in primary cells require more laborious
cytokine analysis (such as cytokine bead arrays248) to provide immunostimulatory information. Applying this
early stage immunological compatibility testing in parallel with high-throughput
synthesis and computation guided discovery will accelerate the screening
and development of new polymers for immunomodulatory applications.
