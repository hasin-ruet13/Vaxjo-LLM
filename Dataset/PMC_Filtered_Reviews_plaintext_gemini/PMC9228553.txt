Title: Rational Vaccinology: Harnessing Nanoscale Chemical
Design for Cancer Immunotherapy

Cancer immunotherapy trains
the immune system to seek and destroy
cancer cells with high specificity, in stark contrast to traditional
approaches that aim to “cut, poison, and burn” tumors.1 Indeed, conventional methods, including surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation, are fraught with drawbacks. Serious side
effects often arise from insufficient tumor targeting, and in addition,
the dynamic nature of tumor development often inhibits efficacy.2 For example, drug resistance and off-target effects
limit the action of chemotherapeutics,3 and localized treatments (e.g., in situ lesion
treatment, surgical resection, and radiation) cannot generally be
used to control tumor metastasis.4 Thus,
cancer immunotherapies represent an important paradigm shift in cancer
treatment because these methods mobilize the immune system to seek
and destroy existing cancer cells at both primary and distal sites
and, in some cases, induce strong, protective immune responses to
prevent future tumorigenesis.5

The
concept of deploying the patient’s own immune system
to fight cancer dates back to at least the 19th century and has relied
on the administration of “non-self” biomaterials to
activate immune cells to attack tumors. In the 1890s, Dr. William
Coley reported instances of cancer remission following intratumoral
injections of deactivated bacterial mixtures, known as “Coley’s
toxins”.6 Coley’s toxins
consisted of a mixture of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids,
and lipids from different bacteria. These mixtures stimulated the
innate immune system and were “designed” to give patients
severe fevers and simultaneously shrink their tumors. Over the following
century of research, it was determined that the tumors were not eliminated
by the “toxins” but rather killed by immune cells that
they had activated. Indeed, a fundamental principle of modern cancer
immunotherapy involves activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs),
including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and B cells, and training
them to attack tumors through innate and adaptive immune responses.
The innate immune system is formed during prenatal development7 and immediately responds to pathogen invasion,
whereas the adaptive immune system develops during early childhood
as the body continues to encounter novel pathogens8 and respond to specific antigens. Nevertheless, while the
relationship between innate and adaptive immunity is complex,9,10 both rely on the activation of APCs.

The delivery of both
adjuvant, which stimulates the immune system,
and antigen, which enables a targeted immune response, to APCs is
necessary for maximal immune activation (Figure 1).11 Adjuvants
include pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), characteristic
molecular features recognized as foreign; and damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs), molecular features released from cells that are
stressed or damaged.12 These adjuvants
bind to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) within APCs.13,14 Upon activation, APCs secrete proinflammatory cytokines and interferons
to mount an innate immune response. APCs are also involved in the
initiation of an adaptive immune response: they take in antigens (usually
foreign proteins) and process them into shorter peptides. Antigen
peptides with specific immunogenic sequences (e.g., tumor-associated
or tumor-specific), are then presented on the surface of the APCs
by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) as an MHC-peptide complex.15,16 After APC maturation, the MHC–peptide complex then binds
to a T cell, B cell, or other receptors (Figure 1, Signal 1).17 APC maturation, caused by adjuvant-activating PRRs, also leads to
the upregulation of costimulatory markers that bind to the corresponding
costimulation receptors on T cells (Figure 1, Signal 2).18 In addition, as the immune response is triggered, APCs secrete various
cytokines that bind to cytokine receptors on T cells (Figure 1, Signal 3).19 In this way, mature APCs train cytotoxic T cells (also
known as killer T cells) to rapidly multiply and destroy cancer cells
that express the same antigens. Maximal T cell activation and proliferation
require the engagement of a combination of these three signals initiated
by APCs, suggesting the importance of delivering both adjuvants and
antigens to these cells.20

General mechanism of
immune response induced by an immunostimulatory
spherical nucleic acid (SNA). Antigens and adjuvants delivered by
an SNA vaccine are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and
APCs undergo maturation. The mature APC produces three signals to
activate naïve T cells against cancer cells. Signal 1: Antigens
presented by major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the APC
surface bind to the T cell receptor (TCR). Signal 2: Costimulatory
molecules bind to T cells. Signal 3: Cytokines are released from APCs
and bind to T cells. These activated T cells undergo proliferation
and attach to cancer cells to achieve tumor killing. Note that this
type of SNA has been used as a model system to introduce and comprehensively
develop the concept of rational vaccinology.

The choice of both adjuvant and antigen is important for vaccine
design, in general, and cancer vaccine design, in particular. With
respect to adjuvant selection, the most commonly employed DAMPs are
aluminum salts (alum).21 Some of the most
widely used PAMPs are unmethylated DNA strands containing multiple
cytosine-guanine repeats (CpG)22 and bacterial
polysaccharides.23 The most common antigens
are immunogenic peptides (vide supra), although tumor-associated
carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are becoming increasingly utilized in
the design of cancer vaccines24 as aberrant
glycosylation is a hallmark of many cancers.25

Vaccine development has evolved significantly from when antigen
and adjuvant materials were simply mixed and coadministered as a bolus
injection. In the case of cancer vaccines, their composition has changed
over time as immunologists have gained mechanistic insights into the
immune cascade and have identified new targets and ligands that activate
immune cells against cancer. Among the various formulations, antigenic
protein and adjuvant nucleic acid systems are a widely explored combination,26−28 and the identification and isolation of the most immunogenic portions
of these have allowed for the development of vaccines with higher
drug-to-carrier ratios that elicit fewer nonspecific immune responses
than those containing larger proteins and nucleic acids.29,30 Due to advances in solid-phase chemical synthesis,31,32 peptides and oligonucleotides can now be precisely synthesized in
large quantities. In addition, overall vaccine efficacy can be enhanced
when nanomaterials are used to deliver immunotherapeutic agents.33,34 The incorporation of adjuvants and antigens into a nanoparticle
platform protects them from premature biodegradation and increases
adjuvant/antigen codelivery to particular immune cells, thus reducing
systemic toxicity and enhancing the targeted immune response.26 The application of chemical design and nanoscience
principles to cancer immunotherapy has led to the rapid clinical development
of many nanoscale vaccines.33,35

Indeed, scientific
and technological advances that span multiple
disciplines have paved the way for the development of next-generation
nanoscale cancer vaccines. Nanoscale structural, chemical, and compositional
design allows researchers to systematically synthesize cancer immunotherapeutics
that impart high protective immunity with limited off-target effects;
this systematic development process is termed “rational vaccinology”.36 A wide range of nanoparticles have been used
as carriers for antigens and adjuvants,37 and the effects of nanoparticle size, shape, and charge on biodistribution
and cellular uptake have been investigated.38,39 These studies have illuminated the fact that the precise spatiotemporal
control of the codelivery of antigens and adjuvants is critical to
successfully mobilizing the immune system against a desired target.40 With new immunotherapeutic agents being continuously
developed, it is crucial for biologists and immunologists to engage
with chemists, materials scientists, and engineers in the collaborative,
coordinated development of universal methods to engineer potent immunotherapies.
The relative importance of each new parameter in a library of general
synthetic design rules can be evaluated by engineers and data scientists
using analytical high-throughput screening techniques and machine
learning tools. In this Outlook, we present recent advances in vaccine
design via rational vaccinology and discuss how transdisciplinary
research is necessary to prepare novel vaccines in this context, primarily
demonstrated by spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as a model system.

Innate immunity is categorized by the rapid response of certain
classes of immune cells upon the detection of danger signals.41 These responses are triggered by the activation
of PRRs,42,43 which include toll-like receptors (TLRs),
C-type lectins (CLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and cytosolic
nucleic acid receptors.44 Among the various
PRRs, TLRs were the first to be identified, and their importance in
innate immune response was recognized by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology
and Medicine.45 As such, TLRs are one of
the most widely studied and utilized PRRs for innate immune activation.46 Adjuvants function as danger signals to induce
an innate immune response. Upon activation of TLRs by adjuvants, APCs
express costimulatory markers (Signal 2) and secrete cytokines (Signal
3) that are required for T cell activation (see Figure 1). Many TLRs are located in the endosome
(TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9) and are activated by nucleic acid (double-stranded
RNA, single-stranded RNA, and single-stranded DNA, respectively) or
small molecule adjuvants. Endosomal TLR activation triggers strong
immune responses,47 and since many nanoparticles
enter cells via endocytosis, delivering immunogenic
nucleic acids using nanoparticles has become a popular and successful
strategy.37,48

It has been shown that systems in
which nucleic acid adjuvants
are delivered to cells by nanoparticles significantly outperform those
where the fully soluble, linear nucleic acids are administered.49 Nanoparticles deliver multiple copies of nucleic
acids to the endosomes at once, due to their multivalent structure.50 This results in a high accumulation of nucleic
acids in the endosome, thus promoting receptor clustering and inducing
strong immune signaling.51 The innate immune
response is affected by the structure, conjugation chemistry, and
ligand composition of a nanovaccine (Figure 2A), and here, we primarily use spherical
nucleic acid nanostructures as a model system to illustrate this point
with other systems also being briefly discussed.

Examples of nanovaccine
design parameters. (A) Innate immune responses,
dictated by adjuvant processing, can be tuned by nanovaccine structure
(encapsulated or surface-presented), ligand anchoring chemistry, and
composition and identity of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR)
ligand(s). (B) Adaptive immune responses, dictated by antigen processing,
can be tuned by nanovaccine structure (encapsulated or surface-presented),
chemistry linking the antigen to the nanovaccine, and the composition
and identity of the antigen(s). SNAs are used as a model vaccine to
illustrate these dependencies.

When designing nanoconstructs
for the delivery of adjuvants to stimulate TLRs and an innate immune
response, a key consideration is the way in which the TLR agonists
are presented within the nanoscale structure (Figure 2, top left). Nucleic acid adjuvants can be
encapsulated in the core of nanoparticles to prevent their premature
degradation by nucleases, but nuclease stability can also be improved
when oligonucleotide TLR agonists are densely functionalized on the
surface of nanoparticles in a radial orientation in the SNA form.52,53 When oligonucleotides are presented on the surface of liposomal
SNAs (LSNAs, SNAs with liposomal cores), a significantly enhanced
immune response is observed compared to when the oligonucleotides
are encapsulated inside the LSNA (on a per oligonucleotide basis).49,54 This effect can be attributed to two factors: (i) SNAs are rapidly
taken up by APCs through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and (ii) the
presentation of oligonucleotides on the surface of SNAs provides better
accessibility of the adjuvants to the TLRs inside the endosomes.48

In addition, the conjugation density of
the surface-presented adjuvant on the nanoparticle impacts immunostimulation.
For example, SNAs with higher CpG loading densities show stronger
immunostimulatory activities.55 Moreover,
smaller SNAs, which have higher surface curvatures and higher loading
densities per unit area, induce stronger specific immune responses
and minimize unintended cytokine production.56 Higher loading densities induce stronger multivalent binding to
the receptors, and the surface curvature of the construct core can
affect the endosomal organization, which in turn affects the downstream
immune response.57 Likewise, when various
hydrophilic and hydrophobic linkers were used to graft TLR7/8 small-molecule
ligands onto a polymer scaffold, it was revealed that increasing the
conjugation density improved immunogenicity.58−60 The immune
responses have also been toggled by size and architecture (coil vs
micelle vs submicron particle) with the same conjugate components.61 Together, these studies indicate that the structural
location and density of the adjuvant, as well as the size and shape
of the overall nanoconstruct, impact the magnitude of the innate immune
response.

It is also possible to form nanostructures composed
solely of adjuvant.
For example, CpG DNA has been used to synthesize structures called
“nanoflowers”, providing a versatile platform for delivering
immunotherapeutic agents. These CpG nanoflowers were formed via rolling circle replication (RCR), which can be utilized
to produce multiple copies of a single circular CpG DNA template.62 The size of the poly-CpG nanostructure can be
controlled by tuning the RCR reaction time63 or by incorporating positively charged, PEG-grafted polypeptides
that condense the negatively charged nanostructures based on electrostatic
interactions.64 ,65 Other self-assembled multivalent
CpG DNA nanostructures, such as DNA origami,66 tetrahedrons,67 dendrimers,68 polypods,69 and centipedes,70 can be taken up by cells to significantly impact
cytokine secretion; however, more meticulous designs and complex syntheses
may be required to successfully incorporate additional payloads (e.g.,
antigens) without disrupting the structural features that make them
useful.

The chemical properties
of TLR agonist-based nanoconstructs, especially those that affect
stability, impact immunostimulation and are thus another critical
design parameter. DNA is typically hydrophilic, but when it is conjugated
to a lipophilic moiety at a terminus, an amphiphilic bioconjugate
results, which can be inserted into the bilayer membrane of a liposome
(Figure 2, middle left).
For example, a range of lipophilic moieties can be conjugated to DNA
for synthesizing classes of LSNAs with different stabilities. In initial
efforts, LSNAs were synthesized using tocopherol-functionalized DNA.71 Then, cholesterol-functionalized DNA was used
as a building block because it is easier to synthesize and purify.
Later, a diacyl lipid was conjugated to DNA to further improve the
anchoring stability of the strand within the LSNA core.72 More stable SNA structures facilitated multivalent
binding to receptors and thus induced a faster and stronger immune
response. LSNAs formed with diacyl lipid-functionalized CpG DNA exhibited
enhanced serum stability, higher cellular uptake, and stronger immunostimulation
compared to LSNAs synthesized with cholesterol-modified CpG DNA.72 In this case, higher serum stability is also
likely to lead to more extensive serum protein corona formation, which
can enhance receptor-specific endocytosis.73,74 In addition, liposomal core stability also affects overall SNA stability,
where more stable core formulations (i.e., lipids of higher phase
transition temperature) lead to more robust immunostimulation and
higher antitumor efficacy.75 Taken together,
these results suggest that the conjugation chemistry used to attach
CpG DNA adjuvants to liposomes, as well as the lipid chemistry, can
be used to modulate immunostimulation. These works represent a small
sampling of the ways in which chemistry can be employed to modulate
the stability of adjuvant incorporation into nanoconstructs, and many
other schemes exist that could be explored to further probe the relationship
between nanoconstruct chemistry and immune activation.

Nanoconstruct design
allows for multiple classes of adjuvants to be codelivered to APCs
on a single structure and, moreover, for the ratio of the individual
adjuvants on the structures to be tuned (Figure 2, bottom left). These features are important
because different CpG DNA sequences, even if they both target TLR9,
likely do not activate the innate immune system in the same way.76,77 For example, synergistic immune activation was achieved with SNAs
by employing a combination of class A and class B CpG DNA, which stimulates
different components of the innate immune system. Enhanced activation
was achieved when both classes of CpG were combined on the same SNA
with controlled stoichiometry.78 Such “sequence
multiplicity” promotes the activation of both early and late
endosomal TLR9 during intracellular trafficking, unlike the single-component
class A or B CpG SNA structures, which only briefly activate TLR9
in one of the stages. By analyzing the intracellular trafficking kinetics
of each SNA component, the sequence stoichiometry was modulated to
achieve potent activation. In this example, the proportion of each
class of CpG on the SNAs correlated with the amount of time for which
they remained in each activating organelle (i.e., early or late endosomes).

It can also be advantageous to codeliver multiple PRR ligands to
enable parallel signaling, especially if these ligands coactivate
pathways that require different adaptor proteins without interference.
Although both TLR3 and TLR9 can trigger the production of nuclear
factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and inflammatory cytokines, TLR3 activation
signals interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3), which
produces interferon (IFN)-β, while TLR9 activation signals IRF7,
which leads to the secretion of IFN-α; IFN-α and IFN-β
are necessary for the maintenance of memory T cells (long-lived, antigen-specific
T cells).79 Interestingly, IFN-α
has also been shown to upregulate TLR3 expression.80 The coadministration of CpG DNA that activates TLR9 and
polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic double-stranded
RNA analogue that activates TLR3, has been shown to lead to synergistic
immune activation in a variety of cell lines and animal models.81−85 Targeted codelivery is enhanced, and immune activation is prolonged
and strengthened when nanoscale vaccines containing two components
are delivered compared to that when single-component nanomaterials
are used.86−88

In summary, the structural arrangement, conjugation
chemistry,
and composition of PRR agonists in nanovaccine constructs like SNAs
play important roles in stimulating the innate immune system. Immune
responses induced by nanovaccines can be modulated by understanding
how structural arrangement affects agonist binding to PRRs, how stability
affects PRR binding efficiency, and how composition, especially of
multiple components, enables synergistic activation. With such knowledge
in hand, future directions involve rationally designing and exploring
structures and conjugation chemistries in the context of multiadjuvant
systems.

Antigens are biomolecules that can be used to train
the adaptive
immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells, making them critically
important for antitumor activity and vaccine function. Typically,
antigens are peptides or proteins, and they fall into two categories
in the context of tumor immunotherapy: (i) antigens that are highly
overexpressed on tumor cells but that are also expressed to a lesser
degree on healthy cells (tumor-associated antigens) or (ii) antigens
that are expressed only on specific tumor cells (tumor-specific or
neoantigens).89 In order for the adaptive
immune response to be triggered, antigens must be delivered to activated
APCs in high concentrations. Once engulfed by an APC, the antigen
gets processed and presented on either the MHC-I, activating cytotoxic
CD8+ T cells, or MHC-II, which activates helper CD4+ T and B cells
(Signal 1) (Figures 1 and 3A).90 T cell
activation has historically been of particular interest because of
its central role in the adaptive immune response,91,92 although there are a variety of other immune cells and processes
in play (e.g., B cell activation).93 Regardless
of identity, peptide and protein antigens are often poorly immunogenic
when administered on their own because they are rapidly degraded by
proteases and cleared from the body.94 In
addition, both antigen presentation and costimulatory molecule expression
are required for T cell activation (Figure 3A), and the timing and duration of these
processes play important roles in promoting T cell activation and
avoiding T cell anergy (where T cells become inactivated following
prior stimulation).95 Thus, nanoscale delivery
systems have been explored for the inclusion of antigens.96,97

Synchronizing
the kinetics of antigen and adjuvant processing improves
the antitumor immune response. (A) Schematic illustration of the intracellular
trafficking of a nanoscale vaccine following cellular uptake that
is required for the presentation of signaling molecules (ER = endoplasmic
reticulum). (B) The nanoscale architecture of vaccine components affects
the kinetics of signaling molecule presentation. The antitumor immune
response correlates with kinetics, as illustrated by the corresponding
(C) tumor growth curve and (D) survival analysis, with synchronized
signaling molecule presentations leading to the most effective antitumor
response (modified from ref (36)).

Researchers have primarily focused
on developing nanoscale cancer
vaccines that incorporate MHC-I antigens to elicit CD8+ T cell responses,
which underpin the adaptive cellular immune response.98 However, the development of vaccines that elicit both cellular
and humoral responses could also be bolstered. Multiple examples of
nanovaccines targeting helper CD4+ T cell and B cell activation, central
to humoral responses, exist. However, fewer CD4+ T cell- and B cell-based
peptide epitopes have been discovered as compared to CD8+ T cell-based
epitopes, presenting an important current challenge for biologists
and immunologists. The treatment efficiency of B cell-based vaccines
relies on their ability to elicit the expression of neutralizing antibodies
against peptide epitopes.99 These epitopes
might not be recognizable by CD8+ T cells to induce robust, specific
antitumor immune responses because they are typically processed and
presented via the MHC-II pathway. However, there
is evidence indicating that introducing both T and B cell epitopes
in vaccines can elicit highly focused antibody responses against tumor-specific
antigens.100 Thus, inducing both CD8+ and
CD4+ T cell responses by incorporating multiple tumor-associated peptide
antigens in SNA structures could have great potential to stimulate
both cellular and humoral antitumor immune responses.

The structure,
chemistry, and composition of the antigens should
be carefully considered when designing nanovaccines that trigger a
robust adaptive immune response (Figure 2B).

The
physical arrangement
of antigens within nanoscale vaccines (Figure 2, top right) strongly influences antigen
delivery and overall vaccine immunogenicity and performance. For instance,
a recently developed antiviral SNA encapsulating antigen [the receptor
binding domain (RBD) of the full spike protein] against SARS-CoV-2
was found to robustly activate naïve B cells in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to the simple mixture
due to the novel multivalent three-dimensional architecture of the
SNA and the ability to optimally present both adjuvant and antigen.101 Another strategy involves presenting the antigen
on the nanovaccine surface. This structural arrangement has been found
to be highly immunogenic because the multivalent display of peptide
epitopes on a nanoparticle surface mimics the multivalent display
of protein antigens on viral surfaces.102 In the case of the SNA model system, the structural arrangement
of antigens was found to have a profound impact on vaccine performance.36,103 A series of LSNAs were synthesized, containing the same number of
CpG DNA and peptide antigens per construct but with the peptide in
different structural arrangements (Figure 3). In these vaccines, the antigen was either
encapsulated in the liposome core (SNA-E), anchored onto the surface
in the same manner as the CpG DNA (SNA-A), or presented on the outermost
surface through conjugation to a complementary DNA sequence that was
hybridized to the surface-bound CpG DNA (SNA-H) (Figure 3B). The kinetics of antigen
presentation and immunostimulation by adjuvant (as measured by costimulatory
marker expression) were elucidated, and it was found that both signals
were best synchronized when SNA-H was used. Of these three structures,
SNA-H elicited the most potent antitumor immune response (Figure 3C) and drastically
extended animal survival (Figure 3D).

This study illustrates a key aspect of rational
vaccinology—that it is the structural arrangement of the vaccine
components, not the identities of the components alone, that dictates
overall vaccine efficacy. Rational vaccinology suggests that adjuvant
nucleic acid sequences or therapeutic antigen peptides that have failed
out of clinical trials may demonstrate increased potency when incorporated
into a nanoscale vaccine structure. This was found to be true in the
case of SNAs, where prostate-specific membrane antigen, which failed
to achieve clinically desirable efficacy on its own, was found to
achieve substantially improved immunogenicity when incorporated into
SNA form.104 In a unique example of antigen-only
vaccine design, strong immune responses were observed when ovalbumin
(OVA) peptide antigens were assembled into nanofibers with surfaces
that displayed the epitope.105

An
alternative strategy to surface presentation is to physically
encapsulate antigens in liposomes because chemical conjugation is
not required, and the hollow core can be utilized;106 however, the encapsulation efficiency and nanoparticle
stability may limit the overall efficacy of structures prepared using
this approach. It can be difficult to control how much cargo is encapsulated
and how quickly it is released from the nanoparticle core.107 Strategies that involve tailoring the chemistry
of the core structures (liposome108 or
multilamellar vesicles109) to tune their
stability and antigen release have been devised to overcome these
issues. In the latter example, OVA was used as a prototypical antigen
and encapsulated in multilamellar vesicles, where an inter-bilayer
cross-linker was used to stabilize the construct until exposure to
lipases in the endolysosome.

It is
important to note
that, when peptide structure is altered, peptide presentation and
immunogenicity may be impacted;110 how
the antigens are chemically conjugated to the nanovaccine, and their
chemical form when they are released, can significantly affect downstream
processing. Thus, the design and synthesis of the antigenic components
on nanoscale vaccines should be carefully considered (Figure 2, middle right). For instance,
the chemical conjugation method utilized to link the peptide antigens
to the complementary DNA sequences hybridized to the surface-bound
DNA in SNA-H (see Figure 3B) has a dramatic impact on antigen processing and downstream
T cell response, in terms of both activation and proliferation.111 In this system, the use of a “traceless”
linker resulted in the cleavage and release of the peptide antigen
from the SNA scaffold in an unmodified form (i.e., with no added chemical
moieties), while a “cleavable but nontraceless” linker
resulted in the release of a peptide with a pendant group and a “noncleavable”
linker control did not foster cleavage and release. The use of the
traceless linker led to up to an 8-fold improvement in T cell proliferation
compared to when SNAs with the other two types of linkers were used.
Higher levels of cytokine and T cell activation were also observed
with the traceless SNA formulations. Furthermore, these traceless
linkers were designed with different cleavage rates to fine-tune the
antigen release rates and therefore control antigen presentation kinetics.112

In another study, the processing and
presentation of OVA peptides chemically conjugated to polymeric nanoparticles
revealed that the use of reducible linkages led to higher antigen
presentation and enhanced vaccine performance relative to when nonreducible
linkages were used. These results suggest that the use of nonreducible
linkages may interfere with antigen presentation and downstream activation.113

A potent nanoscale vaccine also was prepared
that was composed
of high-density lipoprotein-mimicking nanodiscs conjugated to antigen
peptides through a reducible linker.114 Specifically, the OVA-derived peptide epitope SIINFEKL was covalently
conjugated to the nanodiscs through a disulfide linker as well as
electrostatically complexed with CpG DNA adjuvant. Improved codelivery
of adjuvant and antigen to lymph nodes and sustained antigen presentation
on dendritic cells was observed compared to their soluble counterparts.
Similarly, experiments involving polymeric nanoparticles containing
OVA protein functionalized via disulfide groups and
electrostatically complexed CpG DNA show that OVA conjugation to the
nanoparticle significantly increases antigen presentation relative
to simple vaccine mixtures.115

The composition and identity
of antigens within nanoscale vaccines can be tailored to elicit the
antigen-specific immune response that induces tumor killing (Figure 2, bottom right).
Furthermore, multiple classes of peptide antigens can be delivered via the same nanoparticle to enhance the antitumor immune
response.116 Cancer vaccines that target
multiple tumor antigens have the potential to more efficiently target
the tumor cells by the simultaneous recognition of multiple antigens.
For this reason, it may be beneficial to deliver a combination of
different antigens in a single construct.117 In a recent example, mesoporous silica microrod vaccines combined
with poly(ethylenimine) were synthesized to contain peptide antigen
pools from melanoma and colorectal carcinoma.110 The resulting structures elicited broad immune responses
and decreased tumor escape.

Alternatively, proteins isolated
from tumor cells, called lysates, can be utilized as the antigen source
in nanoscale vaccines. The use of lysates can address the shortcomings
of some peptide-based vaccines, including immune evasion caused by
tumor mutation and low antigen presentation on the tumor cell surface.118−120 The immune system was potently activated against tumors when protein
lysates from melanoma cells were encapsulated in porous polymeric
scaffolds together with TLR agonists and chemokines (a cytokine subclass)
to recruit APCs to the infection site.121 However, it is important to note that the manner in which lysates
are isolated and prepared can have a dramatic impact on immunogenicity
and vaccine potency.122 This feature may
be attributed to the types of danger signals produced by tumor cells
when subjected to different processing methods123 as well as the production of different antigens based on
processing methods.124 Indeed, it was discovered
that, for liposomal SNAs with encapsulated tumor cell lysates, lysates
that were oxidized via exposure to hypochlorous acid
were significantly more immunogenic than lysates that had not been
oxidized.125 This enhanced immunogenicity
is thought to be due to chemical and structural changes to the lysate
antigen that occur upon oxidation, changing how it is recognized and
processed within immune system pathways.126

These examples highlight that the structural arrangements,
conjugation
and modification chemistry, and composition of antigens in nanoconstructs
play important roles in stimulating the adaptive immune system. When
these parameters are changed, so too are antigen processing and presentation
kinetics and efficiency. Future directions involve the design of novel
structural arrangements or combinations of multiple arrangements that
allow one to tune the antigen presentation kinetics or prolong antigen
presentation time. New chemical modifications of antigens for more
efficient antigen processing may also be desirable. In addition, other
molecular compositions that support immune function, beyond adjuvants
and antigens, should be considered for integration into future nanoscale
vaccines. Indeed, checkpoint inhibitor therapy has become a standard
combination therapy for a broad spectrum of cancer types.127−129 In checkpoint inhibitor therapy, monoclonal antibodies are administered
to block regulatory checkpoint receptors that prevent tumoricidal
immune function, and such types of antibodies can be incorporated
into SNAs via the protein corona.74 Cytokines have also been incorporated in vaccine designs
as potential adjuvants. For example, the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2)
was explored in a combination therapy due to its ability to regulate
T cell and natural killer cell responses.130 Furthermore, chemokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor, that draw immune cells to tumor sites have also been investigated
as vaccine components due to their ability to regulate dendritic cell
development and subsequent T cell activation through the management
of costimulatory factors. However, it remains a challenge to determine
the ideal dose for optimal immune activation, and this issue has hindered
clinical translation.131 These aspects
may benefit from high-throughput screening techniques.

As presented
above, there are many design parameters related to
the chemistry and structures of nanomedicines that can affect immune
response and efficacy. With such a vast design space, it is challenging
to directly evaluate combinations of effects by picking and choosing
parameters from across different nanoparticle systems.132 However, researchers can take advantage of
high-throughput screening techniques to probe the combinatorial design
space, and this is one area where it is important for chemists and
materials scientists to interface with computational chemists and
data scientists. Self-assembled monolayers for matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization (SAMDI) mass spectrometry is a useful tool in
this context.133,134 SAMDI uses a high-throughput
mass spectrometry plate that is coated with a self-assembled monolayer
presenting a moiety to selectively capture analytes and then quantify
the analyte concentration. In a pilot study, high-throughput screening
with SAMDI was used to test the design space of a library of 960 SNAs
where 11 independently controlled properties of the nanoparticle core,
antigen, and adjuvant were varied, and their effects on immune activation
were studied.135 After treating cells with
SNAs, SAMDI was used to measure cytokine production and secreted alkaline
phosphatase present in the cell culture supernatant, indicating the
level of immune activation (Figure 4A).136 The data were analyzed
using statistical models to identify leading effectors and nonlinear
mixed effects between different parameters. It was found that conjugation
chemistry has an exceptionally strong effect on immune activation—this
and other findings from this study were used to establish design rules
for achieving maximally potent SNAs.135 Given the vast multidimensional space, these data only represent
a small subset of the samples that can be produced. However, the data
can be used for supervised machine learning via structure–activity
relationship analysis to predict the performance of untested variants
with high statistical confidence (Figure 4B).135 With new
antigens being identified and new material structures being designed,
such a process will facilitate a rapid understanding of the structure–activity
relationships of nanomedicines without the need to test the entire
library of possible designs. Indeed, when the data from these libraries
were used to train the model, it was found that only a small subset
of structures (16%) was needed to accurately make predictions. The
results of these studies can be used to identify the properties (or
nonobvious or nonlinear combinations of properties) that are most
important for maximizing immune activation in high throughput, guiding
future studies toward the properties that have the greatest impact
on performance.

data can be processed using supervised machine learning and can predict

Although some vaccine design parameters
(e.g., size and concentration)
can be regarded as continuous variables in the context of data science
and machine learning, most of the design parameters presented herein
(e.g., structure, chemistry, and composition) are non-numerical and
therefore discrete in nature. It may be challenging to use traditional
supervised machine learning to predict the design space because these
discrete parameters are difficult to directly incorporate into regression
models. Therefore, deep learning techniques may be needed to obtain
the quantitative structure–activity relationship for new nanoscale
vaccine designs and predict their potential effects on efficacy. These
findings and models should also be combined with clinical pharmacology
to predict clinical performance and perform clinical trials most efficiently,
bringing clinicians into the fold. An in vitro–in vivo performance correlation is important, but a valid in vitro–clinical performance correlation is arguably more important.
Therefore, it is crucial to establish a set of quantitatively stable
design rules for nanoscale vaccines, perhaps by also incorporating
patient conditions as parameters to produce personalized nanomedicines
that could work most effectively for an individual. It is important
to note that data mining techniques to search for similar sequences
and predict their therapeutic efficacy in nanoscale vaccine designs
have the potential to substantially improve vaccine development.

In summary, the importance of rational
vaccinology in SNA vaccine
development, and cancer vaccine development more broadly, is clear:
besides the identity of individual vaccine components, how and when
they are presented in the delivery system are also critically important
for immunotherapeutic efficacy. Even if the components are carefully
discovered for specific targets, the incorrect structural arrangement
of these components may lead to inferior performance. Therefore, experts
from a range of disciplines are needed to fully realize the potential
of rational vaccinology-based approaches to immunotherapy. Biologists
and immunologists are needed to elucidate the signaling pathways and
identify new immunotherapeutic agents. Chemists can design and synthesize
chemical modifications of immunotherapeutic agents and develop novel
conjugation chemistries. Materials scientists can design nanomaterials
with properties that are more favorable for immunotherapeutic efficacy.
Engineers can identify novel structural and compositional design spaces
for incorporating various immunotherapeutic agents into the nanoscale
vaccine systems. Finally, data scientists can analyze the design space
and identify key parameters for rational vaccine designs and guide
researchers in other fields. Researchers with backgrounds that are
traditionally unrelated to immunotherapy can widely contribute their
expertise toward advances in rational vaccinology at the nanoscale.
This collaborative approach to rational vaccinology recently culminated
in human clinical trials in which CpG adjuvant-carrying TLR9-agonistic
SNAs were administered to patients alone and in combination with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (NCT03086278; NCT03684785).137,138 This SNA drug shrunk tumor targets in 37% of patients with a confirmed
overall response rate of 33% at the highest selected Phase 2 dose
for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).49

Moving forward, chemists and other researchers should continue
to use rational vaccinology to elucidate the fundamental principles
necessary for the development of cancer vaccines that are both highly
immunogenic and highly tolerable. This effort will be enabled by the
advanced understanding of how structure impacts function [e.g., targeting
(or multitargeting) to and retention in specific cell types or subcellular
spaces, temporal control, stability and component release, delivery
of large materials, prodrug behavior, and toxicity] and how the arrangement
of vaccine components can be tuned at the nanoscale to afford various
maximal immune responses. With design rules established and key design
parameters identified, scientists can significantly broaden the impact
of immunotherapies by taking advantage of tools from chemistry, biology,
materials science, engineering, and data science to find the formulations
of the most potent immunotherapeutics. This knowledge, along with
the toolkit developed to date in the context of SNAs and other materials,
will allow for the rapid design, synthesis, testing, and deployment
of nanovaccines against diverse cancer types and the application of
the lessons learned to the treatment of novel bacterial and viral
pathogens and autoimmune and other diseases. Indeed, of the infinite
number of nanostructures that can be prepared, we can use the prototypical
SNA system as a guide, and chemical knowledge described herein can
be used to build other structures if a similar structure-focused protocol
is adopted. In fact, if one follows this supposition to a logical
end point, one concludes that the ultimate vaccine structures will
be modular, nanoscale in size, and molecularly pure where the position
and connectivity of every atom has been optimized for signaling control
and therapeutic efficacy. This is where molecularly precise entities
like peptide-functionalized dendrimers may play a significant role.139,140
