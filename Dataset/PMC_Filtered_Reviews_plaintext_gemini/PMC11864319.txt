Title: Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype distribution in low- and middle-income countries of South Asia: Do we need to revisit the pneumococcal vaccine strategy?

Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is a gram-positive bacteria that colonizes the upper respiratory tract of humans.1,2 Globally, it represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adults.3 It is responsible for causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), viz., meningitis, septicemia, bacteremia, and bacteremic pneumonia, as well as non-IPD, such as acute otitis media (AOM) and non-bacteremic pneumonia, in both adults and children.4,5 The disease burden (incidence and mortality rates) is highest in children <5 years and adults >65 years, as well as in individuals with compromised immune system or chronic medical conditions.5,6 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that S. pneumoniae is responsible for killing > 300,000 children under 5 years of age globally every year, with the majority of them occurring in developing countries.7 It is also the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia globally.7 Antibiotics have been used as front-line agents for the treatment of S. pneumoniae infections, but the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains is a major concern for clinicians.8,9 The WHO has included S. pneumoniae as one of the 12 priority pathogens, exhibiting increased resistance to antibiotics.10,11
S. pneumoniae produces several virulence factors, and the capsular polysaccharide is considered to be the most important one, enabling binding to the cells and evading the host immune system.5,6,12,13 More than 90 serotypes have been identified based on these capsular polysaccharides, and only a subset of them are responsible for causing pneumococcal disease.5,6,14 These serotypes also form the basis of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), and only a fraction of the serotypes are included in the vaccine formulation because of the complexity involved in the manufacturing of PCVs.5,15,16 Pneumococcal disease is endemic globally, but the distribution of S. pneumoniae serotypes differs with respect to their disease severity, invasiveness, antimicrobial susceptibility, geographies, immunization history of individuals, age groups, and with time.4,5,16–19

Pneumococcal carriage is seen more frequently in children than adults, and thus children are considered to be the main reservoir and transmitter of this pathogen.13 In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), S. pneumoniae has three times higher colonization as compared to those in high- income countries (HICs).20 The burden of pneumococcal diseases remains high in LMICs.21 Globally, there are over 1,400 cases of pneumonia per 100,000 children annually, with the greatest incidence occurring in South Asia (2,500 cases/100,000 children) and West and Central Africa (1,620 cases/100,000 children).22 South Asian countries have the highest mortality due to IPD.23 Population-based studies in South Asian countries have shown that S. pneumoniae was responsible for 12.8% of invasive bacterial diseases, whereas retrospective hospital-based studies showed that 28% of them were due to S. pneumoniae.23

The implementation of PCVs has played a significant role in reducing the burden of pneumococcal disease globally through direct protection of vaccinated individuals and indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals by reducing the nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission of vaccine-type (VT) pneumococci.24,25 Vaccines also serve as an effective strategy to address the burgeoning issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in S. pneumoniae.9 As per the VIEW-hub Report: Global Vaccine Introduction and Implementation, 159 countries have introduced PCVs into their national immunization programs (NIPs) as of August 2024.26 PCVs have also been introduced in many LMICs with the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance27 Evaluating the impact of vaccines in LMICs is of paramount importance because of differences in pneumococcal epidemiology, including transmission rates.28

Despite the remarkable success achieved with PCVs, the prevalence of IPD has increased by non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs), partially offsetting the total disease reduction.4,29–32 This phenomenon, referred to as serotype replacement, is due to the greater serotype diversity observed in developing countries.29 Although this phenomenon was initially considered controversial, it is now well established.33 These NVTs may replace the VTs in the upper airways, resulting in increased transmission and disease, as well as undermining the effectiveness of the currently available PCVs.19,34 They have the tendency to be highly invasive in nature as well as exhibit high levels of resistance to antibiotics.29,35 Two mechanisms for serotype replacement have been suggested, which are described in detail by Lo et al. and van Tonder et al.30,36 Hence, it becomes imperative to monitor the serotype data post-PCV introduction to identify new emerging serotypes and gain insights into the evolving epidemiology of S. pneumoniae.4,37 Also, robust vaccine strategies are warranted to address the issue of NVTs.38

In this comprehensive review, we bring forth the distribution and distinctive characteristics of pneumococcal serotypes in LMICs of South Asia. It sheds light on the prevailing trend of NVTs gaining prominence globally, showcasing their distinct features across the region. An elaborate overview of the current pneumococcal vaccine landscape is provided, highlighting the merits and demerits of PCVs, along with alternative strategies (protein-based and whole-cell vaccines [WCVs]) that are being investigated to address the limitations of PCVs. Furthermore, we provide valuable recommendations for future vaccine design and development to mitigate the threat posed by these NVTs.

We conducted a comprehensive literature search on PubMed to identify relevant studies that were published between 2012 and 2024 (at the time of writing the mansucript) using the keywords, viz., “pneumococcal disease,” “pneumococcal serotypes,” “pneumococcal conjugate vaccines,” “invasive pneumococcal disease,” “non-invasive pneumococcal disease,” and the respective South Asian country name (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, India, and Maldives). Studies that were conducted between 2012 to 2024 were included in our analysis. Also, studies that commenced before 2012 but concluded in or after 2012 were also included in our analysis. Studies published in native/regional languages other than English were excluded. Table 1 highlights the S. pneumoniae serotypes reported in LMICs of South Asia from different studies conducted between 2012 and 2024 (at the time of writing this manuscript). Table 2 highlights the different characteristics of NVTs observed in this region.Table 1.Pneumococcal serotypes reported in LMICs of South Asia from different studies conducted between 2012 to 2024.Studies included1Age groups2Serotypes/Serogroupsreported3Serotypes covered underPCV134NVTsMixedSerotypesCountriesand referencesRemarksSerotype distribution and AMR patterns of pneumococcal isolates collected from individuals with IPD and non-IPD and from carriage studiesCustomized PCR for invasive pneumococcal serotype determinationComparison of S. pneumoniae serotype distribution, AMR patterns, and carriage from community children and children with clinical pneumonia;

Characteristics of NVTs observed in LMICs of South Asia from different studies conducted between 2012 and 2024.

1Drug resistance refers to resistance to one or more classes of antibiotics.

2Unspecified includes cases that have not mentioned whether the pneumococcal infection was invasive or non-invasive in nature.

3Serogroups/serotypes marked with *in South Asia were responsible for causing deaths.39,68,74,96

4Mixed serotypes, as observed in Table 1, have not been included in the analysis because of the inconsistency in how they are named and interpreted across the referenced research articles. This inconsistency limits the ability to accurately characterize mixed serotypes within the study’s framework, thus warranting their exclusion to maintain clarity and analytical appropriateness.

Abbreviations: NVTs: Non-vaccine serotypes; IPD: Invasive pneumococcal disease; Non-IPD: Non-invasive pneumococcal disease; NP: Nasopharyngeal.

There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines available that are clinically available, viz., PPSVs and PCVs, targeting multiple serotypes.12,102 PPSVs stimulate the B cells by cross-linking the B-cell receptors (BCR), which leads to the production of immunoglobulins.103 This type of immune response is usually a T cell-independent response, which implies that these polysaccharides are capable of activating B cells in the absence of T helper cells.104,105 These polysaccharides cannot be processed and presented in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and cannot be recognized by T helper cells.104 Due to the lack of T cell collaboration, the antibodies are of low affinity and are composed mainly of immunoglobulin M (IgM) with limited isotype switching to immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA).104 It results in a lack of production of new memory B cells along with depletion of the memory B cell pool, resulting in hyporesponsiveness to future doses of vaccine.103 PPSV23 was licensed in the United States of America (USA) in 1983.5 It included 23 serotypes, which were responsible for 85% to 90% of IPD globally.29 It is approved for use in individuals 50 years of age or older and persons aged ≥2 years who are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease.106 PPS23’s protective efficacy has been consistently demonstrated in several studies as well as meta-analysis.107–111 In immunocompetent individuals, the vaccine has an efficacy of 65% against pneumococcal infections with serotypes included in it.112 The effectiveness against IPD in immunocompetent adults ranges from 56% to 81% but is lower in individuals with compromised immune status.12 It reduces the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) but does not prevent it. It does not reduce the incidence of noninvasive pneumonia.12 Moreover, it does not generate immunological memory in children <2 years, and hence it is not effective in this population.12 Also, it does not reduce pneumococcal carriage.12,112

To overcome this drawback and elicit a protective immune response in children <2 years, capsular polysaccharide vaccines conjugated to a protein carrier were developed.5,112 Conjugation of the polysaccharide to a suitable carrier protein converts it into a T cell-dependent antigen.113 This conjugation of the capsular polysaccharide directs the processing of the carrier protein by the polysaccharide-specific B cells, followed by the presentation of the peptides to carrier-peptide specific T cells in association with MHC class II molecules.103 When B cells receive help from T cells, they proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells, with class switching to IgG, and memory B cells. These memory B cells undergo rapid proliferation and differentiate into plasma cells upon subsequent encounter with the antigen, producing high antibody titers.103,113 A 7-valent PCV (Prevnar, Pfizer) conjugated to cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197) was developed and licensed in the United States (U.S.) and the European Union (EU) in 2000 and 2001, respectively.12,102 The vaccine included serotypes, which were identified as causes of IPD in the U.S.13 However, after the introduction of PCV7, a change in the epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases was observed, and NVTs (not included in PCV7) emerged as the most prevalent ones, a phenomenon known as ‘serotype replacement.5,112 For example, serotypes 1 and 5, which were not included in PCV7, were responsible for a high burden of illness and deaths in low-income settings.13 Another example was 19A, a problematic serotype, which exhibited antibiotic resistance.12,13 This serotype replacement led to the development of PCV10 (Synflorix, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) and PCV13 (Prevnar 13, Pfizer), which were introduced in 2009.4,12 Surveillance data from different countries implementing PCVs in their NIPs has prevented disease not only in vaccinated individuals but also in unvaccinated adults and children through herd immunity.13 Although PCVs were originally developed for pediatric use, clinical studies conducted in adults have shown their ability to prevent diseases in individuals of all ages through direct protection.13 A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the impact of PCV10 and PCV13 in reducing the incidence of CAP in children <5 years demonstrated that these vaccines showed a reduction of 17% and 31% in the hospitalization rates for clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, respectively, in children <24 months.114 In children aged 24–59 months, these vaccines showed a reduction of 9% and 24% in the hospitalization rates for clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, respectively.114 A systematic review evaluating the impact of PCV10 and PCV13 on all-cause, radiologically confirmed, and severe pneumonia hospitalization rates and pneumonia mortality in children 0–9 years old across several WHO regions demonstrated reductions ranging from 7% to 60% for all-cause pneumonia hospitalization, 8% to 90% for severe pneumonia, 12% to 79% for radiologically confirmed pneumonia, and 45% to 85% for pneumococcal confirmed pneumonia.115 Pneumonia-related mortality saw a reduction of 10% to 78% across different regions.115 A study conducted by Bennett et al. evaluated the impact of PCV10/PCV13 on IPD incidence in children <5 years and adults ≥65 years compared to the pre-PCV period.116 It evaluated 275,582 cases from 47 surveillance sites in 29 countries (primarily HICs [80%]). The study demonstrated that IPD declined by 58% to 79% in children <5 years and by 4% to 29% in adults.116 The Serum Institute of India (SII) has developed an affordable 10-valent PCV (Pneumosil), which provides protection against serotypes that are responsible for causing serious illness in developing countries.12 Walvax Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Walvax) has developed and manufactured a 13-valent PCV (Weuphoria), which has been marketed in China, Morocco, and Thailand.117

However, after the introduction of PCV10 and PCV13, the issue of serotype replacement continued, and newer vaccines were required to prevent pneumococcal diseases caused by serotypes 8, 12F, and 22F.5,118,119 A systematic review of the serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae causing IPD in children in countries that have introduced PCV13 revealed that non-PCV13 serotypes contributed to 42.2% of the childhood IPD cases in the post-PCV era.37 There were differences as per geography, viz., 57.8% in North America, 71.9% in Europe, 45.9% in the Western Pacific, 28.5% in Latin America, and 42.7% in South Africa. The predominant non-PCV13 serotypes were 22F, 12F, 33F, 24F, 15C, 15B, 23B, 10A, and 38.37

In light of this grim situation, two new PCVs, viz., PCV15 (VAXNEUVANCE, Merck) and PCV20 (Prevnar 20, Pfizer), have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in 2021.5,12,120,121 PCV15 is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease in individuals 6 weeks of age and older.122 PCV20 is approved for the prevention of invasive diseases in individuals 6 weeks of age and older; prevention of otitis media in individuals 6 weeks through 5 years of age; and active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia in individuals 18 years of age and older.123 Prevnar 20, which was built using Prevnar 13, includes seven additional serotypes that have been associated with antibiotic resistance, heightened disease severity, invasive potential, high case fatality rates, and prevalence in pediatric pneumococcal cases.124,125 Moreover, these seven serotypes are among the most common responsible for IPD in the pediatric population in the USA.124,125 Biological E Ltd. has developed a 14-valent PCV, viz., PNEUBEVAX 14, which received approval from the Indian drug regulator, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), in 2022 for manufacturing and commercialization in India.126 It offers protection against two new serotypes, 22F and 33F.126 A 15-valent PCV has been developed by Tergene Biotech Pvt. Ltd. and manufactured at AuroVaccines Pvt. Ltd., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.127 The Indian drug regulator has granted permission to Tergene in 2022 to manufacture and market the vaccine.127 In 2024, the USFDA approved CAPVAXIVE (V116), a 21-valent PCV developed by Merck.128 The vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia in individuals 18 years of age and older.128 It includes eight unique serotypes responsible for approximately 27% of IPD cases in adults 50 years of age and older and approximately 30% in adults 65 years of age and older, as per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.128

Panacea Biotech has developed an 11-valent PCV, viz., NuCoVac-11, which is currently in phase 3 trial. The company has also developed a PPSV23, which is in preclinical development.129 Techinvention Lifecare Pvt. Ltd. has developed a 16-valent PCV that is currently in preclinical studies.130 GBP410 is a 21-valent PCV that is jointly developed by SK Bioscience and Sanofi. The vaccine has demonstrated immunogenicity and safety in phase II trials and is expected to enter phase 3 trials in H1 of 2024.131 AFX3772, a 24-valent PCV developed by Affinivax (acquired by GSK), is currently in phase 2 development.132 This vaccine candidate is based on the highly innovative multiple-antigen presenting system (MAPS) platform technology.132 A 30-plus-valent pneumococcal candidate vaccine is also in preclinical development.132 VAX-24, developed by Vaxcyte, is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing PCV that will be entering phase 3.133,134 VAX-31, another vaccine developed by Vaxcyte, is a 31-valent PCV, which is expected to enter phase 1/2 clinical study during the fourth quarter of 2023.135 VAX-31 and VAX-24 are designed to improve upon the standard-of-care PCVs for both children and adults by providing coverage for serotypes that are responsible for a significant portion of IPD as well as high case-fatality rates, antibiotic resistance, and meningitis.134 Preclinical immunogenicity evaluation of a 24-valent PCV developed by Merck has been conducted in adult monkeys.136 Inventprise Inc. has developed a 25-valent PCV that is currently in phase 2 trial.137

In light of recent findings, it has become increasingly evident that a decline in immunogenicity against shared serotypes has been noted with the adoption of higher-valency PCVs.155 This observed trend, while pointing toward a potential decrease in immune response, poses uncertainties regarding its clinical implications.155 While reduced immunogenicity has been observed among higher- vs. lower-valency PCVs, the trend is inconsistent.155 Different vaccine components, platforms, technologies, and manufacturing processes can affect serotype-specific immunogenicity.155 Consequently, further exploration through additional research is needed to fully comprehend the impact and effectiveness of these new vaccines.155

Exploring various avenues to enhance immunogenicity and overall vaccine efficacy is key in this scenario.155 Innovative conjugation processes, diverse carriers, strategic use of adjuvants, and advancements in vaccine platforms represent promising approaches that could potentially offset any reduction in immunogenicity.155 Some of these strategies include choosing appropriate carrier proteins to prevent carrier-induced suppression, such as utilizing single or multiple conserved S. pneumoniae proteins or employing enhanced carrier protein (eCRM) to facilitate conjugation reactions outside the primary T cell epitope region.155 Techniques like preserving the structural integrity of capsular polysaccharides through polysaccharide activation or using specific linker moieties between polysaccharides and proteins are also being explored.155 Novel vaccine platforms, like MAPS, in vivo bioconjugation, virus-like particle (VLP) technology, and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology are being investigated to enhance overall B cell and T cell responses while generating enhanced serotype-specific IgG levels without the need for adjuvants.155 By striving to maintain or elevate immunogenicity levels and subsequently boost vaccine effectiveness, it’s possible to extend the coverage and protection offered by PCVs, especially as their valency increases.155

VAX-24 contains eCRM, a proprietary carrier protein with non-native amino acids (para-azidomethyl-L-phenylalanine) that undergo site-specific conjugation to pneumococcal polysaccharides activated with a small-molecule linker (dibenzocyclooctyne).156 Site-specific conjugation utilizing click chemistry allows consistent exposure of T cell epitopes, reduction in carrier protein to pneumococcal polysaccharide ratio, and augments manufacturing process consistency to improve PCVs by increasing the coverage of serotypes and minimizing carrier suppression.156 VAX-24 has demonstrated promising results in a phase 1/2 trial by targeting a wide array of pneumococcal serotypes without compromising the immunogenicity.157

Despite the widespread use of PCVs in vaccination programs and continuous advancements in serotype coverage, the underlying reasons for decreased antibody responses, particularly in infants and the elderly, remain incompletely understood.158 Deeper insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing protective antibody responses against S. pneumoniae could potentially inform the development of adjuvants that enhance these responses.158

Moreover, in alignment with the guidelines set forth by the WHO, the evaluation of noninferiority between higher- and lower-valency PCVs relies on specific criteria related to IgG response rates and IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs).159 Each serotype is individually assessed to determine noninferiority, with the WHO underscoring that meeting the predefined criteria for either IgG response rates or GMCs should suffice for regulatory approval.159 The correlate of protection for IPD is typically measured by noting the levels of vaccine-induced, serotype-specific IgG, with a protective threshold set at 0.35 µg/ml.159 In 2008, the WHO reviewed data on PCVs, including effectiveness studies in Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), and the USA.159 The data indicated variability in IgG concentrations and thresholds, with some suggesting alternative thresholds and the correlation of opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers for a few serotypes for vaccine effectiveness.159

Administration of additional pneumococcal vaccines may be required in adults due to waning immunity. For example, the effectiveness of PPSV23 wanes over several years, and high-risk individuals may require revaccination every 5–10 years.111 As mentioned earlier, serotype replacement has been observed with the implementation of PCVs, where niches occupied earlier by VTs have now been colonized by NVTs.29,38,160,161 Both PPSVs and PCVs are serotype-based vaccines and therefore elicit a serotype-specific immune response.162 Geographical differences with respect to serotype distribution have led to reduced vaccine effectiveness when they were implemented in geographies where the serotypes were not covered by the vaccines.29 PCVs have weak efficacy at mucosal sites, such as for pneumonia and otitis media.12,38
S. pneumoniae undergoes phase variation, wherein the capsule shifts stochastically from high to low expression levels.12,38 This is a result of anatomical-site-specific selective pressures in the host environment.12,38 The pathogens present on mucosal surfaces are less encapsulated as compared to those present in the blood, thereby exposing surface adhesins.12,38 Therefore, the antibodies directed at the capsule are not efficient in opsonophagocytosis at the mucosal level.12,38 Serotype coverage by PCVs in developed countries is substantially higher compared to developing countries, where pneumococcal diseases are caused by a wider spectrum of serotypes.162 Vaccine failures have been reported following immunization with PCV10 and PCV13.162,163 A systematic review published by Oligbu et al. identified serotypes 19B, 6B, and 4 associated with vaccine failure in countries with established PCV programs.164 PCVs cannot offer protection against the emergence of S. pneumoniae strains, which are found among non-typeable isolates.165 Capsular switching has been observed post the introduction of PCVs.29 Although PCVs provide protection from infection, but not all serotypes are covered with equal potency.12 For some serotypes, viz., 1, 3, and 5, the levels of functional antibodies against capsular polysaccharides induced by the vaccines and detected by opsonophagocytic killing are not ideal.12 PCV manufacturing is an extremely complex and expensive process, making it unaffordable for the developing countries, which can lead to low vaccination coverage.102,162 One of the glaring examples is the sub-Saharan countries, which still have the highest mortality rates in children <5 years, even after 10 years post-PCV licensure.102 Increasing the valency of PCV also poses challenges with respect to conjugation.102 A crucial issue of PCV is the binding of the carrier protein to the capsular polysaccharide to elicit a robust immune response as compared to the capsular polysaccharide alone.102 Adding additional serotypes to the formulation results in blunting of the immune response to individual serotypes due to carrier suppression.12 An increase in valency as well as the dosage of the carrier protein in the formulation can lead to immune response interference, both in the vaccine itself and other vaccines that are administered previously, jointly, or subsequently.102,166 These interferences result in an imbalance in several arms of the immune response and hence require readjustment in each new vaccine formulation.102

In light of the above-mentioned drawbacks, novel vaccines based on a non-serotype-independent approach targeting conserved antigens are warranted and have been extensively investigated.10,38,102,112,140,162,165 An ideal pneumococcal vaccine with broader coverage, the ability to induce mucosal and systemic immunity, and the ability to prevent primary intranasal colonization and invasive disease is highly desirable.12 Several protein-based vaccines and whole-cell (live-attenuated and inactivated) vaccines are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies.10 Protein vaccines targeting the highly conserved virulence proteins can confer broad serotype coverage.29 Different types of protein vaccines that are investigated include recombinant proteins (individual or in combination), fusion or hybrid proteins, nanoparticle-packaged fusion or hybrid proteins, recombinant protein-boosted PCVs, and capsular polysaccharide-conjugated recombinant protein carrier.162,167 Protein-based vaccines offer several advantages, such as the production of opsonophagocytic antibodies, providing respiratory tract protection, preventing invasion of the pathogen in different organs, neutralizing pneumolysin cytotoxicity, cross-protection against additional childhood pathogens, and blunting complications arising out of disseminated bacterial infections.38,162 It can also serve as a cheaper option for children in developing countries, provide coverage for a wide range of serotypes responsible for IPD, and offer an alternative option to prevent recurrent infections.140 With respect to manufacturing, there are less hindrances associated with structural differences and variations, a drawback that is commonly observed with conjugate vaccines.140 On the flip side, protein antigens have numerous limitations. They contain non-repeating conformational epitopes for antibody binding as compared to capsular polysaccharides that have repeating and conformationally less-restricted antigenic determinants.140 This poses challenges to mounting a protective antibody-mediated immune response as well as explains the difficulty in developing protein-based vaccines.140 Also, they may not be present in all clinical isolates and may be poorly conserved due to significant sequence heterogeneity.140 Another drawback of protein antigens is their accessibility to opsonic antibodies.140 WCVs present a wide range of antigens in their native form and can confer broader protection against S. pneumoniae.29,102 These vaccines can serve as an economical alternative to PCVs in developing countries because of their low manufacturing costs.29,102 WCVs can be developed from killed or live-attenuated whole-cell or by using genetically modified strains of pneumococcus for ensuring safety and retaining immunogenicity.9 Inactivated WCVs offer the advantage of carrying several types of antigens, which are common to all serotypes.10 These vaccines are relatively safe as the organism is completely inactivated.10 Live-attenuated vaccines enhance humoral and mucosal immune responses after a single-dose, as compared to inactivated ones.168 Other merits and demerits of these vaccine technologies are described in detail by Kumraj et al.169

From Tables 6–8, it is evident that there are numerous S. pneumoniae proteins, such as pneumolysin (Ply), pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC), pneumococcal histidine triad protein D (PhtD), pneumococcal surface antigen A (PsaA), etc. that are investigated as vaccine candidates either alone or in combination with other proteins using suitable adjuvants and delivery systems. Some of these proteins have also been explored as carrier proteins to conjugate vaccines. Many of these candidates have shown promising results in animal studies, while some have demonstrated their safety and efficacy in clinical trials. Similarly, many WCVs (inactivated and live-attenuated) have shown promising results in animal studies and clinical trials. However, further studies are warranted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of these protein vaccines and WCVs.

Some of the vaccine technologies, such as mRNA vaccines, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccines, non-replicating viral vaccines, etc., grabbed the limelight during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There exists a possibility that the next generation of pneumococcal vaccines may be developed using such technologies.102

LMICs should have a robust surveillance system to monitor the pneumococcal serotype prevalence and distribution, the emergence of NVTs, the burden of IPD, and the impact of PCVs. This will give a better and in-depth understanding of the evolving epidemiology of S. pneumoniae, aid in formulating and implementing vaccination policies, and guide the development of next-generation pneumococcal vaccines.These countries should have access to high-end and quality diagnostics to understand the AMR pattern of S. pneumoniae. Antibiotic stewardship programs and national AMR plans should be religiously implemented. Data from the AMR pattern can play a decisive role in selecting the appropriate serotypes for PCV development.Pharmaceutical/Biotech companies should customize or tailor PCVs as per the region-specific prevalence and disease-causing potential of pneumococcal serotypes based on robust surveillance data as well as taking into consideration the pros and cons of adding additional serotypes. For example, companies can develop or modify the existing PCV formulations and incorporate serotypes as shown in Table 9.Table 9.Plausible serotypes that can be incorporated in the existing PCV formulations.Region*Plausible serotypesSouth Asia2, 8, 13, 20, 29, 31, 34, 38, 39, 45, 10A, 10F, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15B, 15C, 16F, 17F, 18B, 19B, 22F, 23B, 28A, 28F, 33F, 35B, 35F, 6C, 6D, 7B, 9 L, 9N1) *These serotypes have been implicated in IPD, non-IPD, and drug resistance as shown in Table 2.Abbreviations: IPD: Invasive pneumococcal disease; Non-IPD: Non-invasive pneumococcal disease.Serotype replacement due to PCVs and regional differences in the dominant serotypes warrant the inclusion of additional serotypes in the existing vaccines. Adding a new serotype will increase the complexity and the cost. This in turn can affect affordability and accessibility in countries with high pneumococcal disease burden and lack of robust healthcare infrastructure. To mitigate this risk, a non-serotype-based approach, such as a protein-based vaccine, a live-attenuated vaccine, or an inactivated vaccine, would be an ideal one. Such vaccines target the highly conserved proteins across all S. pneumoniae serotypes and can provide broader protection as compared to the existing PCVs. However, large, robust studies in different geographies are warranted to demonstrate its efficacy and safety in clinical trials as well as the real-world effectiveness of these vaccine candidates.

For example, companies can develop or modify the existing PCV formulations and incorporate serotypes as shown in Table 9.Table 9.Plausible serotypes that can be incorporated in the existing PCV formulations.Region*Plausible serotypesSouth Asia2, 8, 13, 20, 29, 31, 34, 38, 39, 45, 10A, 10F, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15B, 15C, 16F, 17F, 18B, 19B, 22F, 23B, 28A, 28F, 33F, 35B, 35F, 6C, 6D, 7B, 9 L, 9N1) *These serotypes have been implicated in IPD, non-IPD, and drug resistance as shown in Table 2.Abbreviations: IPD: Invasive pneumococcal disease; Non-IPD: Non-invasive pneumococcal disease.

Serotype replacement due to PCVs and regional differences in the dominant serotypes warrant the inclusion of additional serotypes in the existing vaccines. Adding a new serotype will increase the complexity and the cost. This in turn can affect affordability and accessibility in countries with high pneumococcal disease burden and lack of robust healthcare infrastructure. To mitigate this risk, a non-serotype-based approach, such as a protein-based vaccine, a live-attenuated vaccine, or an inactivated vaccine, would be an ideal one. Such vaccines target the highly conserved proteins across all S. pneumoniae serotypes and can provide broader protection as compared to the existing PCVs. However, large, robust studies in different geographies are warranted to demonstrate its efficacy and safety in clinical trials as well as the real-world effectiveness of these vaccine candidates.
