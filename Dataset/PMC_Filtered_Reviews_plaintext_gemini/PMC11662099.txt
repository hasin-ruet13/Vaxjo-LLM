Title: Biotechnological Interventions for the Production of Subunit Vaccines Against Group A Rotavirus

Group A rotaviruses (RVs) cause life‐threatening gastroenteritis worldwide in young humans and animals under 5 years. Gastroenteritis is the intestinal inflammation that causes severe dehydrating diarrhea, increasing morbidity and mortality of children and calves. Globally, rotavirus causes about 215,000 deaths of children each year and hospitalized hundreds and thousands more [1]. The high proportions of these deaths are from developing countries in Asia and sub‐Saharan Africa. The global cost of rotavirus infections, including outpatient visits and hospitalizations, exceeds US$ 200 million annually (https://preventrotavirus.org/rotavirus-disease/economic-burden/). Rotavirus infection has also caused calves' mortality, leading to significant economic losses to farmers and the dairy and beef industry worldwide. As per one estimate, calves' mortality due to diarrhea causes economic losses of approximately one billion yen per year in Japan [2]. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) licensed two live‐attenuated oral vaccines against rotavirus, Rotarix and RotaTeq, which have been introduced into the national immunization programs of 120 countries worldwide, of which 53 have accessed support from the global alliance for vaccines and immunization (GAVI) (https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/en/). These vaccines have higher efficiency (85%–96%) in several high‐ and middle‐income countries [3] whereas their efficiency is lower(49%–72%) in developing countries, where the impact of rotavirus disease is higher [4]. Several factors have been implicated in their lower efficacy in developing countries. These are the deficiency of micronutrients (vitamin A and Zn), high frequency of malnutrition, competition with enteric infections and concomitant disease at the time of vaccination, and interference by gut and milk microbes and maternal antibodies [5, 6]. Further, these vaccines are not easily accessible to populations in developing countries due to their lengthy developmental procedures, high manufacturing costs, low biosafety and high risks of intussusception [6, 7]. Efforts are being made to enhance the efficacy, manufacturing capacity, safety, and affordability of traditional vaccines (i.e., attenuated or inactivated live virus) to develop new non‐replicating rotavirus recombinant subunit vaccines based on viral protein antigens, indispensable to decrease the disease load in greatly affected populations. Plant‐based productions have now emerged as a highly potent platform over fermenters based on microbial (bacterial and yeast) and animal cells due to their intrinsic safety (that do not support the replication of human pathogens and are free from microbial toxins), simplicity (requires no sterility during production), greater scalability (can be grown in open fields), and low‐cost (requires only sunlight, water, and minerals for growth and production) for vaccination [8, 9, 10]. The recent plant‐produced pharmaceuticals, taliglucerase alfa and ZMapp, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Newcastle disease vaccine by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Medicago's COVID‐19 vaccine by Health Canada and the safety of some plant‐derived vaccines for influenza, cholera, and Bacillus anthracis in clinical trials have also been demonstrated [11]. Recombinant subunit vaccines, viral‐based particles, and nanoparticles produced in plants via stable or transient viral antigen(s) expression could overcome the adverse consequences of live‐inactivated or attenuated vaccines. The subunit vaccines have shown high specificity, high biosafety, and a reasonable cost but are low in immunogenicity compared to whole virus vaccines. However, introducing antigens from the most widely circulating rotavirus strains into plants would effectively develop a universal multivalent rotavirus vaccine, which may be safe, free from cold chain, and easy to transport for access to remote and difficult‐to‐reach populations at low cost. This study discusses the currently licensed rotavirus vaccines, along with the latest advances in the production of rotavirus subunit vaccines and virus‐like particles (VLPs) in bacteria, yeast, insect, and mammalian cells, transient and stably transformed plants (derived from nuclear [transgenic] or chloroplast [transplastomic] transformations), DNA based and cell‐free platforms for the first time [11]. The expressed antigens have maintained their immunogenic properties, eliciting protective immune responses in animal and human models. Recent advances in reverse vaccinology (RV) have been presented in designing novel multiepitope rotavirus vaccines. Besides vaccines, an overview of the other management strategies like passive immunization, single chain antibodies, immunobiotics, and novel antivirals is also highlighted along with genome editing and reverse genetics (RG) approaches for the future improvement in vaccines and antivirals to sustainably control rotavirus diarrhea, especially in developing countries.

Bovine/human rotaviruses (HRVs) are members of the genus Rotavirus of the family Sedoreoviridae. The rotaviruses obtained their name from the Latin word “rota,” meaning wheel‐like structure. These are comprised of the non‐enveloped icosahedral capsid (80 nm isometric diameter) enclosing a total of ~18.55 kb long linear genome made of 11 double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments in the size of 0.6–3.3 kb with conserved 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions. Each segment is a gene that encodes for a protein, except the 11th segment, which encodes for two proteins. These RNA genomic segments are translated into six structural (VP1–VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural (NSP1–NSP5 or NSP6) proteins [12]. The six structural proteins form three concentric layers of the viral capsid. Core protein (VP2) forms an inner layer that encloses the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (VP1), the capping enzyme (VP3), and the viral genome. A middle layer of VP6 protein further surrounds this to form a DLP (double‐layered particle), which gains an outermost VP7 protein layer and spike‐forming VP4 protein. VP4 protein consists of two subunits, VP5* at C‐terminal and VP8* at N‐terminal. These subunits facilitate virus entry by interacting with various receptors present on the cell surface [12]. The host–cell attachment protein, VP7, is a glycoprotein (G antigen, G genotype), and the antibodies‐neutralizing protein VP4 is a protease‐sensitive protein (P antigen, P genotype). Both these proteins are located on the outer layer of the rotavirus [3, 12]. The nonstructural proteins (NSP1–NSP6) participate in several virus functions like genome replication, particle assembly, viral gene expression stimulation, and host innate response regulation [12]. Rotavirus transcriptase synthesizes a cap (m7GpppG) at 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of their genome and contains a consensus sequence at 3′ UTR but lacks a polyA tail. Rotavirus gene segments, their size, molecular weight, length of noncoding sequence, properties, and functions are represented in Table S1.

Rotavirus strains have been identified as 10 serogroups/species (A to I or J) based on serological reactivity and genetic variability of VP6 inner capsid protein, and into various genotypes encoding VP7 (G type) and VP4 (P‐type) within species (Table S2). The A, B, and C serogroups cause disease in man and various animal species. The most widely studied virulent and frequently isolated rotavirus strains of serogroup A cause contagious diarrhea in children and various domestic mammals and bird species [3]. Animal and human group A RV strains have been identified with 36G and 51P genotypes (https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/viralmetagenomics/virus-classification/rcwg). The most widely circulated HRV genotypes belong to six VP7 G (G1–G4, G9, G12) and three VP4 P (P4, P6, P8). Among them, six combo groups or serotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and G12P[8], are accountable for over 90% of the serious rotavirus infections [3, 7]. Serotypes G1, G6, G8, and G10, together with P [1], P [5], and P [11], are most commonly found with bovine group A rotavirus infections (Table S3).

Unfortunately, no specific treatment for rotavirus infection is available except supportive care with oral rehydration salts to prevent dehydration, zinc supplementation, and continued feeding [13]. Some specific treatments are Rotavirus group A (RVA) specific bovine colostrum [14], monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [15], egg yolk polyclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) YAbs [16], probiotics/immunobiotics [17], drugs [18], and natural herbal compounds [18, 19]. Some strategies have reduced diarrhea fluid loss and duration, but none is accepted as a consistent treatment for rotavirus diarrhea.

Passive immunization involves the administration of already mature immunoglobulins (antibodies, Igs) to overcome infectious diseases. This type of immunity may be natural, where maternal antibodies are transferred to the offspring, inducing protection before their self‐immunity is built up [20]. Passive immunity can also be induced by immunization of cows against HRV, providing colostrums or mature milk with pathogen‐specific antibodies to prevent diarrhea and reduce rotavirus shedding [21]. The bovine milk with rotavirus‐specific immunoglobulins has shown protective effects in mice [22], cows [23], and piglets [24]. Similar passive defense of suckling mice and cows against HRV infection has also been achieved with oral immunoglobulin from the egg yolk (IgY) of hens immunized with rotavirus [25]. Calves are protected from RVA infection on administration of anti‐bovine rotavirus IgY obtained in a noninvasive way (extracted and purified) from egg yolk of hens immunized with the two distinct RVAs genotypes G6P [5] and G10P [2, 11]. Strong cross‐reactivity was seen between the anti‐bovine IgYs and bovine RVA with the same G and P genotypes. IgY, being with high sialic acid, has increased half‐life and improved efficacy against infections [20]. Recently, incorporating oral bovine immunoglobulin in infant nutrition and dairy products may be a brilliant approach to maintaining immune function in weak groups such as infants, children, elderly, and immune‐compromised patients [26]. Passive immunization using animal colostrum or IgYAbs has raised concerns about adventitious viruses and allergic reactions.

Conventional/mAbs have high antigen specificity and affinity and are successfully used to diagnose and treat several diseases. However, their large size (150 kDa prevents them from penetrating tissues and making some epitopes inaccessible) and high production costs limit their therapeutic efficiency [27]. In addition, camelids (camels and Ilamas) serum contains distinct antibodies that do not have light chains and are called “heavy‐chain only” or sdAbs [28]. The single variable region of these heavy chain antibodies called VHH or nanobodies is the naturally occurring antigen binding region. sdAbs are smaller in size (~15 kDa, can easily penetrate dense tissues), possess specificity for epitopes, stable at high temperatures, and extreme pH (conditions such as of the gastrointestinal tract), low immunogenicity, attractive pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties, and relatively low‐production costs [29]. Since camelid's VHH antibody fragments are encoded by only a single gene (vhh) comprising a single polypeptide with no glycosylation, it allows their production in prokaryotic expression systems (bacteria), thus saving time and money. They are also proficiently produced in large amounts of yeast, mammalian, or plant cells with realistic costs [30]. Ilamas immunized with rhesus‐monkey group A rotavirus (RVA) strain produce an anti‐rotavirus VHH (termed anti‐rotavirus protein, ARP1), which has been expressed in rice seeds (termed MucoRice‐ARP1) at high levels by simultaneously suppressing the major rice endogenous storage proteins. ARP1 produced in rice seeds can be consumed directly with minimum processing or purification and stored at room temperature for a long time without losing antiviral activity. This is helpful for remote areas where cold chains are not easy to maintain. MucoRice‐ARP1 neutralizes 11 strains even after long‐term storage (> 1 y) and prevents RVA‐induced diarrhea in neonatal mouse models after heat treatment at 94°C for 30 min [26, 31]. Probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus paracasei) expressing anti‐rotavirus VHH have been developed to deliver therapeutic agents for treating gastroenteritis [32, 33]. Recently, the first clinical trial of oral ARP1 therapy in infants with RVA‐associated diarrhea showed a substantial decrease in stool frequency with no side effects [34]. One more VHH, 3B2, specific to the inner capsid protein VP6, has shown a broader neutralizing capacity against RVA strains at low doses and protected RVA‐induced diarrhea in neonatal mice and gnotobiotic piglets [35]. In a neonatal model, additional postinfection therapeutic therapy with 3B2 or 2KD1 significantly decreased the duration of RVA‐induced diarrhea [36]. The two significant difficulties, like the short half‐life of sdAbs in circulation and their potential immunogenicity, must be resolved before allowing their use in vivo. Several strategies, that is, linking sdAbs with other molecules or pro‐drugs and combining sdAbs that bind various epitopes or have diverse modes of action, allow the development of multivalent compounds with high affinity or efficacy [37].

Immunobiotics administer live microbes in adequate amounts to modulate the host mucosal and systematic immune systems. The immuno‐regulatory probiotic microorganisms (immunobiotic) can protect humans and animals against intestinal rotavirus infections. The immunobiotic strains beneficially alter toll‐like receptor 3‐initiated immune responses in bovine intestinal epithelial cells to reduce the disruption of intestinal homeostasis brought by intraepithelial lymphocytes and increase the resistance to viral infections [38]. Lactic acid bacteria can protect against viral pathogens by modulating antiviral immune responses in humans and livestock animals [39]. The segmented filamentous bacteria promote the protection of mice against RV infection and associated diarrhea in an immune cell‐independent way, presumably by altering the host's gene expression, accelerating the turnover of epithelial cells, or directly neutralizing RV [40]. Studies on gnotobiotic pig and neonatal rat models and human intestinal organoids/enteroids have shown that commensal gut microbiota and probiotics limit the severity of RV infection either by reducing mucin secretion or inducing cytokine interferon lambda (IFN‐λ) and IFN‐α/β or activating cytokine interleukin 22 (IL‐22) and IL‐18 signaling [41]. Further, more studies are required to understand the mechanisms of gut microbiota interactions with RV infection.

Vaccination is the most active measure to control rotavirus infection. The global HRV vaccine market is expected to grow from its estimated valuation of USD 7.20 billion in 2022 to USD 10.36 billion by 2030 (Data Bridge Market Research, Global HRV vaccine market – Industry trends and forecast to 2030, retrieved on November 26, 2024, from www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-human-rotavirus-vaccine-market). Several types of rotavirus vaccines currently approved and under development are presented in Figure 1.

Rotavirus vaccines approved and under development.

Rotavirus causes infection at the mucosal surfaces of the host intestine, and systemic immunity is usually ineffective in providing adequate protection against them. Mucosal immunity induced by oral/nasal administration of vaccines (characterized by the local synthesis of secretory IgA and systemic immunity) provides efficient protection against these pathogens [42]. The first licensed rotavirus vaccine, Rotashield, a tetravalent rhesus monkey‐human reassortment vaccine, was released in the USA in 1998. However, it was withdrawn in 1999 due to an increased risk of intussusceptions (a rare bowel obstruction). Subsequently, four oral, live‐attenuated rotavirus vaccines have been developed and licensed for worldwide use against all broad‐range forms of rotavirus infections (Table S4). These are a monovalent vaccine, Rotarix (RV1, GlaxoSmithKline Biologics, Belgium) and a pentavalent vaccine, RotaTeq (RV5, Merck & Co. Inc., USA) prequalified by the WHO in 2006; Rotavac (Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India) and Rotasiil (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) prequalified in 2018 [43, 44]. These vaccines have tremendously succeeded in preventing and reducing the prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea and hospitalization in children. However, vaccine efficiency differs by region and country. The efficacy of RV1 and RV5 vaccines is higher in developed than middle‐ to low‐income countries. The efficacy of recently prequalified vaccines, Rotavac and Rotasiil, outside of India would be considered only when introduced globally. The implementation of the licensed replicating live attenuated vaccines suffers from difficulties in developing countries due to (i) their high price, (ii) the low efficacies in sub‐Saharan Africa and Asia which account for 90% of all Rotavirus infections worldwide [45], (iii) the risk of reversion to virulence, leading to vaccine‐induced disease, (iv) capability of genome reassortment either with circulating wild strain or attenuated polyvalent vaccines components may result in the emergence of virulent strains resistant to vaccine, (v) Rotavirus symptomatic infection can even occur in vaccinated children in Spain [46], (vi) Rotavirus vaccines including those from India are associated with a considerable risk of intussusceptions [45], and environmental enteric dysfunction in 80% of infants aged 12 weeks [47], (vii) contaminations of globally licensed rota‐vaccines with porcine circoviruses, and (viii) all vaccines except Rotasiil require a cold chain to maintain efficacy, long life span, and transportation. Moreover, the total capacity for rotavirus vaccine production is far less than the global demand [48], which requires strenuous efforts to develop new non‐replicating oral vaccines that are safer, inexpensive, and efficient against rotavirus infection without intussusceptions.

Additional live attenuated vaccines licensed for domestic use have been developed to overcome the limitations of live attenuated oral vaccines and to ensure vaccine diversity and adequate global vaccine supply at low cost. The nationally licensed (ROTAVIN‐M1, POLYVAC, Vietnam; Lanzhou Lamb Rotavirus, Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products, China and RV3‐BB, PT Biofarma, Indonesia) vaccines have been developed in developing countries (Table S5). The manufacturing process details of currently available oral rotavirus vaccines (Rotateq, Rotarix, Rotavac, and Rotasiil) have not been published [49]. However, a low‐cost (maximum of 3–5 USD per entire vaccination course of three doses) commercial production of liquid RV3‐BB rotavirus vaccine formulations stable at 2°C–8°C (refrigerator temperature) for 2 years has been produced from the naturally attenuated RV3 strain of rotavirus. For neonatal use, liquid RV3‐BB vaccines are administrated orally in lower volumes (0.50–1.0 mL) to prevent the virus from becoming inactivated in the stomach's acidic environment [50]. RV3‐BB neonatal (G3P [6]) vaccine is safe and immunogenic in neonates and infants in Indonesia. It can potentially protect infants in other high child mortality countries of Africa and Asia [51].

The Phase I clinical trial of live attenuated hexavalent bovine‐human reassortment rotavirus (G1, G2, G3, G4, G8, and G9) developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, China, is safe in all adults, toddlers, and infants and protect children against rotavirus [52].

Non‐replicating rotavirus vaccines use killed or inactivated protein antigens or their parts (subunits) injected directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the gut and reducing the risk of intussusception. They offer superior efficacy in low‐income countries by avoiding factors hindering immune responses, such as microbiota composition and malnutrition [53]. These include subunit vaccines, VLPs, and nanoparticles. Unlike live oral vaccines, they do not replicate in the intestine.

Subunit vaccines comprise purified whole proteins or their parts (epitopes) as antigens, which are prevalent due to their safety and high‐volume production compared to whole‐pathogen vaccines. However, they are less immunogenic than whole‐pathogen vaccines, requiring adjuvants and repeated vaccination doses to improve their immunogenicity [54]. Their immunogenicity and stability have also been increased by approaches like VLPs and nanoparticle vaccines [55]. VP6 is the major, most immunogenic, and highly conserved protein of the intermediate layer of the rotavirus that contains determinants for viral group and subgroup. VP6 vaccine induces heterologous cross‐protective rotavirus immunity in mice, although induced antibodies against VP6 are not neutralizing. VP6 protein fused with maltose binding protein (MBP: VP6) on administration via several methods, such as intranasally, orally, or intrarectally, to mice, has provided both immunogenicity and protection [56]. The vaccinated mice have shown 100% protection against challenges with rotavirus on coadministration with adjuvant. Oral and intrarectal single dose of MBP: VP6 has protected all mice strains for at least 1 year. The outer protein layer of VP4 and VP7 are targets of neutralizing and protective antibodies (Abs). VP4, a non‐glycosylated protein, is cleaved in the presence of trypsin into a stalk VP5* and globular head VP8* proteins. The mAbs targeted towards VP8, but not VP5, are competent to neutralize virus infectivity by preventing viral binding. VP7 is a major neutralizing antigen that induces neutralizing Abs.

A truncated rotavirus VP8* subunit protein induces highly effective neutralizing antibodies against RV and controls diarrhea. It has low immunogenicity owing to its small size and low valence. VP8* has been used in several vaccine platforms, including recombinant fusion proteins (each VP8* truncation joined at the N‐terminus with the P2 epitope of tetanus toxin [57]) and nanoparticles (VP8* inserted in the structural loops of the norovirus S or P particle) to make it more immunogenic. The National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) have developed a trivalent P2‐VP8 non‐replicating rotavirus vaccine that is made of by fusing three truncated rotavirus VP8 subunit proteins from the most common rotavirus serotypes P[4], P[6], and P[8] with P2‐epitope of tetanus toxin resulting in P2‐VP8‐P[4], P2‐VP8‐P[6], and P2‐VP8‐P[8]. These three recombinants truncated VP8 serotypes are manufactured by expressing them in Escherichia coli and recovered by multiple centrifugation steps, cell lysis, and chromatography, followed by their blending and formulation with adjuvant [58]. Advance trials of the parenteral P2‐VP8‐P[8] and trivalent P2‐VP8‐P[4], [6], [8] subunit vaccines are tolerable and immunogenic in infants and all South African participants (adults, toddlers, and infants) at all doses [59], respectively. The promising safety and immunogenicity of P2‐VP8‐P[4], [6], [8] have advanced the vaccine at phase 3 trials for efficacy testing [60] and vaccine potency (physiochemical stability of each protein antigen) and degradation [61]. Molecular engineering of trivalent non‐replicating subunit vaccine using advanced genomic methods has improved its production (by reducing steps compared to the standard procedure using microbial expression recovery), reduced product‐related modifications (caused by N‐terminal truncation, hyper‐mannosylation, and aggregation), increased titers by concomitantly manufacturing multiple serotypes, and promoted secretion by a yeast (Komagataella phaffii) host [62]. Thus, molecular engineering of trivalent vaccines has reduced the vaccine production cost by minimizing the necessary facility, time, and space. Moreover, the crystallization of the non‐replicating rotavirus vaccine, P2‐VP8, has been designed to reduce purification costs, offer new product storage stability, improve operational flexibility, and reduce required facilities [63]. A two‐step workflow has been designed for screening variants of recombinant protein vaccine antigens [P8] and [P4] under various vaccine formulations to identify a low‐cost, aluminum adjuvanted, multidose vaccine targeted for use in low‐ and medium‐income countries [64]. Further, a conjugate bivalent vaccine (Vi‐ΔVP8*) developed by covalently conjugating a truncated version of the rotavirus ΔVP8* to the Salmonella typhi virulence capsular polysaccharide (Vi) has not only significantly enhanced VP8*'s immunogenicity but also induced immune responses against both antigens in immunized mice [65].

VLPs are non‐replicating rotavirus vaccines produced by co‐expression of viral structural proteins (VP2, VP4, VP6, and VP7) in prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms to form empty single‐layered particles (VP2), double‐layered particles (VP2 and VP6) and triple layered particles (VP2, VP6, and VP7 [66] or VP2, VP6, VP7, and VP4 [67]). Therefore, VLPs do not contain virus genetic material and are safe (noninfectious). Rotavirus‐like particles (RLPs) have been produced in plants and mammalian cells, but their production has been the most successful in baculovirus‐infected insect cells. These VLPs have demonstrated immunogenicity in various animal models and have provided protection of various degrees following infection with the virus [68]. However, plant‐based RLPs made up of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and VP7 in the first human clinical trial were found to be well tolerated. They induced a homotypic immune response in infants [69]. However, their protection efficacy has varied with their protein composition, administration route, adjuvant type, and animal species.

The norovirus (NoV) capsid consists of a critical structural protein (VP1) with shell (S) and protruding (P) domains at the N‐ and C‐terminals, respectively. These domains are structurally and functionally independent. P domain is composed of 24 mer‐P particles in an octahedral symmetry. P particles self‐assemble on the expression of the P protein in E. coli. P particles are highly immunogenic and stable. Each P domain has three surface loops for inserting foreign antigens to produce a new chimeric P particle for immune enhancement, making it a valuable platform for novel vaccine development. The non‐replicating parenterally administered P24‐VP8* nanoparticle vaccine, which contains 24 surface‐displayed HRV VP8*s and a 24 valent core of NoV P particle, has been developed as an exciting dual vaccine towards rotavirus and NoV and produces a significantly higher VP8* specific antibody response than free VP8* particles [70]. P24‐VP8* nanoparticle vaccine has protected immunized mice and gnotobiotic pigs from rotavirus infection and diarrhea [71].

In the E. coli expression platform, Xia et al. [72] produced self‐assembled S60 nanoparticles (with 60 shell domains, each with a free C‐terminus), and these S particles are used to show foreign antigens to increase immunogenicity. The development of SR69A‐VP8* and S60‐VP8* nanoparticles in E. coli has been aided by the introduction of mutations R69A (SR69A) and triple cysteine mutations (V57C/Q58C/S136C) in the norovirus S domain. The chimeric particle, S60‐VP8*, displays 60 rotavirus‐neutralizing VP8* antigens fused to the C‐terminus of the S protein, and mice immunized with S60‐VP8* particles offer protection against homologous murine rotavirus challenge by reducing viral shedding compared to negative control mice and control rotavirus disease [72]. Further, the vaccine self‐assembled to SR69A‐NSP4‐VP8* nanoparticles once the rotavirus antigen NSP4 (RV enterotoxin) was added to previously synthesized SR69A‐VP8*/S60‐VP8* nanoparticles, but this did not further boost the immune response and protection from them. The SR69A‐VP8*/S60‐VP8* nanoparticles respond better to alum adjuvant than CpG adjuvant [73]. The nanoparticles developed from norovirus S and P capsid proteins can efficiently transfer RV antigens to the immune system.

Nucleic acid vaccines are either DNA or mRNA vaccines. A DNA vaccine is a subunit vaccine developed by expressing cDNA encoding for a specific rotavirus protein antigen, VP4, VP6, and VP7, driven by a eukaryotic promoter in cells of the inoculated host. These vaccinations are given intravenously, intramuscularly, intradermally, or by injecting DNA‐coated particles into the epidermis using a gene gun [74]. They effectively evoke both antibody and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses and could induce positive immunity against rotavirus challenge. DNA vaccines are steady and do not require constant cold storage. Rotavirus VP6 DNA vaccine coupled with poly (lactide‐coglycolide) microparticles are administered by oral route and concomitantly induced mucosal immune responses [75]. Similarly, the oral and intranasal delivery of the VP6 DNA vaccine resulted in adequate immunization and subsequent defense against rotavirus exposure [76]. All the rotavirus DNA vaccines have been tested in mice as an animal model. Their significant concerns about safety and clinical effectiveness remain to be determined. The two potential risks associated with DNA vaccines are the incorporation of vaccine DNA into the genome of the host cell or the production of vaccine DNA‐specific antibodies. However, their high stability, durability of response (enhanced cell‐mediated immune responses for long‐lasting immunity), and ease of manufacture (cost‐effective) could make them valuable alternatives to mRNA, adeno, viral vector, and recombinant protein vaccine technologies.

mRNA vaccines consist of antigen‐encoding RNA encapsulated in noninflammatory lipid nanoparticles. These vaccines can elicit more potent immune responses than the DNA vaccines against infectious pathogens. Therefore, they are required in lower doses to stimulate immune responses but require low temperatures for storage. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has partnered with CureVac (Tubingen, Germany) to fund the development of a rotavirus VP8* mRNA vaccine, which is now in the preclinical stage. This vaccine is based on mRNA‐based technology [77]. mRNA has been produced by in vitro transcription using the cell‐free system, avoiding bacterial contamination and chromosomal integration. Further, mRNA is feasible for any protein antigen and cost‐effective at large scales.

RV is a valuable tool that uses a pathogen's proteome and genome data for the in silico multiepitope vaccine design by computational and immunoinformatics approaches [78]. Unlike conventional vaccines, RV eliminates the need for culturing and identifying the pathogen to produce a more stable vaccine at a faster rate, lower cost, and effective for long duration against all circulating rotavirus genotypes with decreased side effects. In silico multiepitope vaccines have been developed for various pathogens, including rotavirus [79, 80]. In‐silico vaccine design has used either the entire rotavirus proteome [81] or the majority of the antigenic proteins (VP7, VP6, VP4, and VP8*) [79, 80, 82] or conserved regions of the fused peptide of VP4 and VP6 [83] for epitope screening. Overall, the methodology used in all these cases was similar; only one case was validated with experimental mice [82]. The procedure for multiepitope vaccine synthesis involves the selection of highly immunogenic and antigenic structural or nonstructural proteins of rotavirus for the in‐silico prediction of the most effective, nonallergenic, and nontoxic CTL (cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte), HTL (helper T lymphocyte), and LBL (linear B lymphocyte) epitopes that are joined with suitable linkers and adjuvants. Various validation studies, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and immunological simulation, are to be conducted to confirm the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses to defense against disease. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies are required to validate the computational findings.

Recombinant DNA technology has facilitated the production of individual full‐length viral antigens or parts of viral antigens or VLPs composed of rotavirus proteins at high levels in heterologous expression systems for their use as proficient vaccines to combat a wide range of viral pathogens.

Three bacterial species, E. coli, Bacillus substilis, and Lactococcus lactis, generally recognized as safe species with adjuvant properties, have been promising candidates for oral vaccination. McCrae and McCorquodale [84] could not express a full‐length bovine rotavirus VP7 antigen in E. coli, probably due to the instability of antigen protein in E. coli. However, they have expressed VP7 antigen as a fusion protein with a C‐terminal extension of βGal (βGal‐VP7) under the control of the bacteriophage λ pR promoter in 5%–15% higher amounts of the total bacterial cell protein after 90 min of induction. Immunization of rabbits and mice with this fusion protein showed neutralization of viral infectivity [84]. A nonstructural protein (NSP3) gene isolated from the Indian isolate of the G2 genotype of HRV has been expressed in E. coli in large amounts and purified to homogeneity [85].

L. lactis, a lactic acid bacterium found in both animals and human intestines, develops rapidly and serves as a vehicle for administering live oral antigens to develop live mucosal vaccine. Various expression systems, including the most extensively used, the nisin‐controlled gene expression, have been developed for accumulating protein antigens in the cytoplasm, anchoring them in the cell wall, or secreting them into the extracellular space. Several rotavirus proteins, for example, NSP4, VP7, VP8, and VP6 have been expressed in L. lactis [86, 87]. The recombinant entire NSP4 has been produced intra‐ or extracellularly using the nisin‐controlled expression system [86]. Though the secretion efficiency of rNSP4 was low, the highest production levels were obtained on the fusion of rNSP4 with lactococcal signal peptide. The recombinant rotavirus proteins produced in L. lactis have shown antigenic and immunogenic properties. Another species of lactic acid bacteria, L. plantarum, has also been used to produce a part of rotavirus VP7 (250 amino acids) [88]. L. lactis offers the prospect of producing other rota proteins that are difficult to produce in E. coli. Cell wall‐derived particles (CWDP), a new generation rotavirus vaccine made from a recombinant L. lactis that expresses a cell wall‐anchored version of the rotavirus VP6 protein, have recently been shown to induce systemic humoral immune responses in mice following mucosal immunization (intranasal) without adjuvant [89]. More research is needed to determine whether they may be used as a substitute for live L. lactis for mucosal antigen delivery.

A recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain has been constructed that displays the heterologous VP8 antigen protein of porcine rotavirus on the spore surface using the spore‐coat protein Cot B as a carrier. The fusion protein, Cot B‐VP8, maintains its immunogenicity on the spores, which, on oral administration, delivers VP8 to the intestinal mucosa and induces both mucosal (IgA) and systemic (IgG) immune responses. B. subtilis spores are used as an antigen delivery vehicle in an alternative rotavirus live mucosal subunit vaccine [90]. VP8* of rotavirus genotype G9P[8] has been expressed and displayed on the surface of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as confirmed by Western blot and Enzyme‐Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) [73]. The developed VP8* cell surface display system can identify and isolate viral receptors in vaccine development.

Yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris are eukaryotic single‐celled and well‐studied organisms with rapid growth and many genetic and genome editing toolboxes. Yeast cells have been frequently used to produce recombinant proteins and VLPs. Three rotavirus structure proteins, VP2, VP6, and VP7 genes have been expressed in the same cell intracellularly in S. cerevisiae and produced triple‐layered rota‐like particles (RLP) as confirmed by immunoblotting and transmission electron microscopy [91]. Subsequently, the raw yeast extracts containing RLPs generated by cell rupture and centrifugation have been proven efficient in producing a defense against infection in adult mice [92]. The use of RLPs as a vaccine has several advantages. These are (i) RLPs are polyvalent vaccines with several genotypes; (ii) the downstream processing avoids expensive purification steps; and (iii) some yeast species showed adjuvant effects. Production of RLP with complex architecture in yeasts could lead to novel vaccine candidates with reduced controlling agency regulations [93]. The success of antigen production may be valuable in a recombinant veterinary vaccine formulation. However, it can be generalized for human use when the costs associated with downstream processes become viable. However, the production and purification of RLPs are not cost‐effective for farm animals.

Rotavirus VP6 protein gene with optimized codons has been expressed intracellularly in two methylotrophic yeasts, P. pastoris and Hansenula polymorpha, to produce VP6 [94]. These yeasts are ideal expression platforms because of their following characteristics: (i) high‐stress tolerance, (ii) ability to utilize various carbon sources, (iii) availability of strong promoters and other genetic tools, (iv) high cell density in the fermenter, (v) low secretion of endogenous protein into the medium, (vi) less hyper‐mannosylation. H. polymorpha is the more effective in producing VP6 protein than P. pastoris [94].

One of insects' most prevalent eukaryotic expression systems is the baculovirus, which allows for the expression of foreign genes in insect cells under the powerful baculovirus polyhedrin gene promoter. This system has been used successfully to produce rotavirus proteins like VP7 in high amounts while maintaining its biological activity of neutralizing rotavirus infectivity in mammalian cells [95]. The role of the rotavirus structural proteins in the generation of CD8+ T cells that mediate the clearing of chronic rotavirus infection in severe combined immune‐deficient mice has identified following immunization of mice with SF9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing any three of the significant structural rotavirus proteins VP4, VP6, VP7 and a polymerase (VP1), but not with VP2, NS53, NS35, NS28, or wild‐type baculovirus [96].

Production of each structural protein of rotavirus in proper amounts and combinations is imperative for the efficient assembly of VLP. Insect cells, Sf9, and larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda on infection with recombinant baculovirus bearing VP2 and VP6 genes from simian rotavirus SA11 have produced/co‐expressed double layered virus particles (VLP2/6) that are released into the medium or hemolymph [97]. Unlike cell cultures, insect larvae produced high levels of VLPs at significantly low cost because they do not require sterile conditions or growth media during production. Triple‐layered particles consisting of three rotavirus proteins, VP2, VP6, and VP7, have been produced in high concentrations in insect cell‐baculovirus expression systems by single infection with three cistronic baculovirus vectors than co‐infection with three monocistronic baculovirus vectors [98]. These results confirm the relevance of more rational vector design for improved efficiency in VLP production, but more information on baculovirus DNA duplication, mRNA stability, protein synthesis, stoichiometry, and thermodynamics of assembly kinetics is needed for enhanced efficacy in VLP production [99]. Recently, a highly efficient baculovirus‐silkworm multigene expression system named Bombyx mori MultiBac has been used to simultaneously express three rotaviruses structural and three fluorescent genes in silkworm larvae, resulting in the formation of VLPs of rotavirus and the color change of larvae. The VLPs yielding 12.7 µg per larva have been purified from hemolymph by ultra‐centrifugation; this Bm MultiBac expression system provides an appropriate, cost‐effective platform to produce VLPs [100].

Mammalian cells coinfected with recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying VP2 and VP6 genes have co‐expressed rotavirus structural proteins, VP2 and VP6, at 25%–30% and 4%–55% levels, respectively, resulting in the formation of intracellular double‐layered rotavirus particles [101]. Transgenic animals produce human proteins in the mammary gland, secreted in milk and eventually extracted from there. Transgenic rabbits whose milk was used to secrete recombinant proteins VP2 and VP6 at a concentration of less than 1 mg/ml also serve as a source of rotavirus antigens. The viral proteins elicited an immune response. In mice infected with the mouse strain of the virus, rectal administration of partially pure milk proteins VP2 and VP6, along with an adjuvant, virtually entirely prevented diarrhea [102]. A milk‐based rotavirus subunit vaccine has been developed by introducing the VP6 gene into rabbit β casein (CSN2) locus using CRISPR/Cas technology into transgenic rabbits [103]. However, the immunogenicity and protection capacity of the milk‐based VP6 subunit vaccines have not been demonstrated. In another study, recombinant VP6‐ferritin nanoparticles self‐assembled in E. coli on oral administration have induced a higher immune response than rVP6 in mice. Moreover, these nanoparticles on transgenic production in mammary glands have protected breastfed pup mice against rotavirus infection [103]. Some other mammalian species (e.g., goat, sheep, cow, etc.) can also be used to produce RV subunit vaccines in their milk, the leading healthy food taken orally without purification by infants and young children.

Plants have gained acceptance as a feasible and flexible host for expressing several recombinant therapeutic proteins like viral antigens, antibodies, cytokines, hormones, enzymes, growth factors, and other functional proteins [104, 105, 106]. Viral full‐length immune‐relevant antigens or their fragments (epitopes) produced in plants are propitious vaccines with several advantages [107]. These are (i) The plants carry out posttranslational modifications (PTMs), for example, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and so forth, which are required for the stability and biological activity of vaccines, (ii) Viral antigens expressing plants or their parts in lyophilized form can be stable at ambient temperature for many years without the loss of recombinant vaccine efficacy as determined by using diagnostics and cell‐based systems and other studies carried out in animals, (iii) The vaccine antigens expressed in edible plants or plant parts like leaves, storage roots, fruits, and seeds of the diverse plant species are called “edible vaccines” which, on direct administration, orally induced mucosal and systemic immune responses without pain and risk of injections and medical professional, (iv) It is challenging to control antigen dose in fresh edible parts of the plants. The antigen dose can be predetermined by freeze‐drying the plant materials. (v) The vaccine produced in plant cells is bio‐encapsulated within the plant cell wall. It is protected from the stomach's harsh environment until and unless digested by gut microbes to release the antigens and improve their bioavailability.

Different plant expression strategies used are: (i) stable expression (via nuclear transformation, transgenic plants or chloroplast transformation, transplastomic plants) or transient expression (agro‐infiltration of the non‐transgenic plant); (ii) use of constitutive or tissue‐specific or inducible expression; and (iii) targeting proteins to suitable cell compartments for their accumulation or PTM and to facilitate downstream processing have been explored [108].

Viral capsid structural (VP4, VP6, and VP7) or nonstructural protein genes, either alone or in combinations, are introduced into diverse plant species using mainly the Agrobacterium‐mediated gene transfer method (Table 1). The antigen genes integrate randomly into the plant nuclear genome, express to produce recombinant antigen protein(s), and are inherited by the next generation. The recombinant plant‐produced antigen protein on oral and nasal administrations retained their immunogenicity. It induced mucosal and systemic immune responses in animals and human trials to protect from severe rotavirus‐induced diarrhea. In many cases, Cholera Toxin B (CTB)/heat liable enterotoxin B (LTB) provides adjuvant activity to the antigen co‐administered orally.

Vaccine antigens against rotavirus expressed in plants.

Transient expression,

A. tumefaciens

VP6, the intermediate capsid protein of the triple‐layered rotavirus, constitutes 51% of the entire virion mass. Because of its excellent immunogenicity and conservation, it provides an effective alternative to the current live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines [128]. Depending on the ionic strength, divalent ion concentration, and pH, it can self‐assemble into highly immunogenic nanostructures, nanospheres, and nanotubes. These nanostructures exhibit immunostimulatory properties and promote immunogenicity of the co‐administered antigens. VP6 has an adjuvant effect and can act as an adjuvant‐free vaccine [129]. Rotavirus VP6 protein has been expressed at low levels of 0.006% and 0.002% of TSP in transgenic potato leaves and tubers, respectively [110]. However, codon‐optimization of the VP6 gene in transgenic alfalfa has expressed a relatively high level of 0.28% of TSP [115]. Oral immunization with transgenic alfalfa has induced specific mucosal IgA and serum IgG antibodies in mice. Further, VP6 produced in transgenic potatoes, Chenopodium amaranticolor, or alfalfa stimulates a passive immune response and protects suckling mice from rotavirus infection [111, 115, 119]. Transient expression of two rotavirus structural proteins, VP2 and VP6, in N. benthamiana, has assembled into VLPs that act as a subunit vaccine for the G9 (P) 6 rotavirus strain [124]. These proteins have also been expressed in the fruits from transgenic tomato plants and developed into VLPs with protective immune response [117]. Codon‐optimized VP6 and NSP4 rotavirus subunits fused with the nontoxic adjuvant subunit B of E. coli heat‐labile enterotoxin (LTB) have been expressed in maize seeds at 0.35% and 0.20% of TPS, respectively. Oral feeding of maize seeds to female BALB/c mice has induced mucosal and systemic responses in mice even after storage for a month [125]. This work paves the groundwork for creating a bivalent VP6‐NSP4 rotavirus vaccine.

VP7 is the outer capsid glycoprotein (38 kDa) and 30% of the total virion mass. It is responsible for defining viral serotypes. It has three antigenic sites: A (aa 87–99), B (aa 145–150), and C (aa 211–223) that can induce neutralizing antibodies; therefore, they can be used as targets for subunit vaccine development. A full‐length VP7 antigen gene from HRV group A has been expressed in potatoes at the soluble protein level of 3.84 µg/mg, and immunization of mice with transformed potatoes has stimulated the mucosal system of the body to secrete IgA to neutralize rotavirus [112]. Expression of a full‐length VP7 gene in transgenic potato tubers at 40 µg/g TSP is stably inherited and expressed over 50 generations and induced cell immunity on oral vaccination of BALB/c mice [118]. The VP7 protein gene of simian rotavirus SA11 fused to the N‐terminus of the ricin toxin B subunit (RTB) has expressed in transgenic potato tubers at 0.03% of TSP [116]. RTB is a monomeric molecule with broad receptor binding specificity that binds to the receptors on the epidermal cell membrane to deliver antigens into gut epidermal cells. The potential of VP7::RTB fusion protein to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against rotavirus challenge is yet to be worked out.

HRV VP7 protein and HRVVP7‐CBT fusion protein have been expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seeds at a level of 0.06%–0.31% of TSP and 0.03%–0.39% of TSP, respectively [126]. Immunization of mice with the transgenic seed extract has elicited an efficient immune response to protect neonatal mice born to immunized dams against rotavirus infection [126]. The fusion protein VP7‐CBT exerts a better mucosal adjuvant effect than VP7. However, the low expression of the recombinant antigen proteins, position effect, gene silencing, the complexity in controlling antigen dosage, and concerns over the public acceptance of transgenic material are to be resolved for the commercial development of plant‐based recombinant vaccines.

Transplastomic plants (generated via chloroplast transformation) have several attractive advantages over transgenic plants (generated via nuclear transformation) for the production of commercial vaccines. These are high transgene(s) expression levels due to the high copy number of chloroplasts; the precise integration of transgenes due to the homologous recombination, the absence of position effect and gene silencing, low risk of horizontal gene transfer due to the maternal inheritance of chloroplasts, absence of human pathogens and toxins, oral delivery with lyophilized powder of transplastomic leaves in capsules, and long‐term storage stability of the recombinant vaccine even at room temperature thus eliminates the need for cold‐chain and facilitates transportation. Transplastomic tobacco plants with an efficient accumulation of bovine rotavirus VP8 protein (~600 µg per g of fresh leaf weight), mainly as insoluble aggregates and devoid of nicotine, were created [122], contrary to bovine rotavirus VP6 in transplastomic plants was unstable in older leaves and primarily present in younger leaves [130]. Immunization of mice with VP8 has protected mice against the bovine rotavirus challenge. Additionally, young mice from immunized dams have demonstrated resistance to an oral challenge with virulent rotavirus. Brucella species (BLS) are protein carriers for antigen transport and immunomodulators. BLS exhibits immunogenic properties on expression as a fusion protein, not co‐expression with the antigen [131]. Bovine rotavirus protein, VP8 gene fused N‐terminally to BLS on expression in transplastomic Nicotiana tabacum plants has produced fusion protein, BLSVP8, at 40% of TSP. Even after a month of room temperature storage, the fresh or lyophilized transplastomic leaves have produced specific neutralizing IgY antibodies in a laying hen model [123]. The lyophilization of transplastomic leaves expressing a stable recombinant fusion of a highly immunogenic BLS to an antigen reduces the cost by simplifying downstream processing. The chloroplast transformation technology has been restricted to only a few plant species.

Transient expression involves expressing viral antigen genes in plants without their integration into the plant genome. The viral antigen genes are introduced into the plants via Agroinfiltration or viral vectors, produce antigen proteins at high levels within days, and can be scalable to commercial levels. It has emerged as a preferred expression system for plant‐made recombinant proteins (Table 1). The bovine rotavirus antigen VP8 portion of the VP4 protein was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana using a modified vector of RNA plant virus, Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) vector TMV‐30B. This vector contains seven histidine amino acids at the C‐terminus of the viral antigen. The plant‐based VP8 retains native antigenic properties and provides passive protection in the murine model [114]. Transient expression of a single chain variable fragment antibody coupled with VP6 protein by an OLLAS tag has been detected immunologically in two cell compartments (cytoplasm and apoplast) of two Nicotiana species (N. benthamiana and Nicotiana sylvestris) to direct the antigen to the dendritic cells for a quick and effective immune reaction [127].

Plant viruses and their VLPs have shown properties of new adjuvants with no harm to animals and humans and are obtained economically [132]. A plant virus, Alternanthera Mosaic Virus (AltMV), coat proteins (CP) in the absence of RNA can produce fibrous VLPs in the laboratory [133]. These VLPs display adjuvant characteristics, resemble AltMV virions, and are stable in physiological conditions [133]. AltMV CP at the C terminus was combined with an RV14 epitope of rotavirus A protein VP6 to create filamentous AltMV VLPs recognized by commercially available rotavirus antibodies [134]. The developed recombinant vaccine (a chimeric protein in the native AltMV coat protein fused with an epitope of rotavirus VP6) does not require additional adjutants. It is a safe candidate against rotavirus infection. Combining other rotavirus antigens of the most widely circulating strains would develop a universal rotavirus A vaccine.

PTMs significantly influence the immunogenicity of vaccines by altering protein structure, stability, and interaction with the immune system. Among the various PTMs, glycosylation plays a crucial role in determining the antigenicity of vaccines. Mammalian cell systems, such as Chinese hamster ovary cells, produce glycosylation patterns similar to human glycans, which reduce immunogenicity and enhance stability [135]. In contrast, plant‐based systems may introduce plant‐specific glycans, such as β1,2‐xylose and α1,3‐fucose, which can provoke adverse immune responses due to their absence in humans [136]. Similarly, insect cell systems, widely used for producing influenza vaccines, generate truncated glycans, which can impact vaccine efficacy and immune recognition [137]. These variations underscore the importance of tailoring PTMs to optimize vaccine immunogenicity across different production systems.

Production systems also influence other PTMs, such as phosphorylation and disulfide bond formation, which affect antigen folding and stability. Phosphorylation is crucial for maintaining the functional conformation of certain antigens, while disulfide bonds ensure structural integrity, particularly in complex proteins like viral glycoproteins [138]. However, bacterial systems, which are cost‐effective and scalable, lack the glycosylation machinery and often require additional steps to mimic human PTMs. Advances in host cell engineering, such as glycoengineered yeast and plant systems, have shown promise in producing human‐like PTMs, reducing the risk of immunogenic side effects [139]. The interplay between PTMs and production platforms highlights the need to evaluate their immunological implications carefully to ensure vaccine safety and efficacy.

CRISPR/Cas is a DNA or RNA genome editing tool that has a role in early diagnosis (by CRISPR/Cas‐based sensors for virus detection) and effectively preventing viral infections. It has also been successfully used to study gene functions, generate virus mutants, and activate and deactivate virus replication. It has emerged as an antiviral therapy that targets either RV entry or replication by knocking out different host factors involved in viral entry or replication but is not required for the host [140]. The CRISPR‐Csy4, a single strand RNA specific nuclease, fused with a major viroplasms' protein, NSP5, to localize Csy4 into the viroplasm (a site of RV genome replication) where it specifically targets and cleaves RV (+) ssRNA replication intermediates, producing defined and discrete deletions in edited viral genome dsRNA segment with the Csy4 target sequence. This allows modification of transcripts produced during the secondary transcription that mainly contributes to the production of rotavirus proteins in infected cells, as confirmed by encoding fluorescent or other tagged reporters [141]. Csy4 activity generates a deletion of 21–45 nt in the RV genome with up to 95% efficiency in one round of replication. There is no known repair mechanism for a cleaved RV genome nor a sequence‐specific programmable CRISPR nuclease targeting dsRNA. The following two examples elucidate the role of CRISPR/Cas in developing rotavirus vaccines.

CRISPR/Cas has been used to integrate VP6 in rabbit β casein (CSN2) locus in transgenic rabbits to produce a milk‐based rotavirus subunit vaccine against rotavirus infection [142]. Vero cell lines, also known as African green monkey kidney cells, are genetically stable continuous cell lines that can safely produce viral vaccines for human use under underspecified regulatory guidelines. Short interfering RNA has been used to identify Vero cell host genes that, on knockdown, increased rotavirus replication and rotavirus vaccine antigen expression. These antiviral host genes were selectively removed using CRISPR/Cas. Gene editing has improved rotavirus vaccine substrates, suggesting a potential path for improvement in rotavirus vaccine manufacturing [143]. A Vero cell substrate with improved RV replication or antigen expression would reduce the efforts, time, and money required to produce enough vaccine viruses. Further, using several guide RNAs to target conserved regions of the viral genome in combination with high‐fidelity Cas would efficiently prevent viral infections. The safety and specificity of CRISPR/Cas would be achieved through the delivery of ribonucleoproteins with suitable carriers.

RG helps in assigning phenotypic changes to genotypic mutations. This approach rescues live (infectious) rotavirus from a mutated genome (addition or deletion in individual viral genes at cDNA level). It generates recombinant rotaviruses that serve as expression platforms for heterologous proteins. It is a potent tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of virus–host interactions, pathogenesis, and viral replication and to generate rational RV vaccines, antivirals, and viral vectors. RG systems for RNA viruses have proved more sophisticated because RNA viruses require in vitro reverse transcription of the genomic RNA into cDNA, in vitro mutation of cDNA, and the development of infectious viruses from mutant cDNAs [144].

Present‐day rotavirus vaccines have been developed from wild‐type RV strains using conventional methods, such as repeated passages of human RV isolate in culture or reassortment between animal and human RV strains. These procedures involve extensive genotyping and screening to find vaccine candidates. RG has enabled it to generate mutants, perform simultaneous alterations in various genome segments, combine favored genome segments, and reassort diverse RV strains. Exploiting RV genes governing viral growth potential, antigenicity, and pathogenicity is also potent. RG has been applied to obtain recombinant RV vaccine cultures of appropriate serotypes that exhibit high duplication activity in cell culture and loss of virulence (for live vaccine). It is a rapid (reduces the time for the emergence of spontaneous mutations during repeated cultures) and repeatable method to enable gene‐targeted reassortment and generate a large variety of VP4 and VP7 reassortment viruses between human and animal RV strains [145]. VP4‐ or VP7‐substituted chimeric virus has been used to characterize RV outer capsid proteins for antigenic potential as an improved seed virus for vaccine production. Once vaccine seed virus strains have been created, VP4 and VP7 genes cloned from RV strains in the target location can be inserted to create vaccine viruses unique to a region or nation [146].
If genes necessary for RV virulence are identified, finding attenuated vaccine candidates through gene alterations is encouraging. The NSP1 gene has been found to determine rotavirus virulence. NSP1 mutants that cannot disrupt the innate immune response of the host cell may be used as attenuated vaccination candidates.RVAs have been used as vectors for the expression of heterologous immunogenic portions of SAR‐CoV‐2 proteins or proteins of other viral pathogens (at the C‐terminus of NSP3) to generate oral live‐attenuated combined vaccines against both SARS‐CoV‐2 and rotavirus [147]. Three nonstructural rotavirus proteins, NSP1, NSP3, and NSP5, can tolerate heterologous gene (like reporter gene, GFP) insertion at C‐termini. Rotavirus expressing GFP has been used to develop a high‐throughput neutralization assay that rapidly evaluates pre‐existing immunity in several animals, including humans [148]. However, the general genome packaging capacity of RV remains to be determined.The RV vaccine is now being produced using Vero cells that are approved for use in human vaccines. However, due to their poor transfection efficiency, there are better cells for recombining RVs. To create affordable RV vaccines with greater efficacy and safety to protect animals and humans against rotavirus infections, the RG method, which rescues recombinant viruses in Vero cells, will be necessary.

Since no specific and compelling FDA‐approved medications are available, developing effective antiviral therapies is urgently needed to combat rotavirus. The studies on host–virus interactions will facilitate a better understanding of the host factors regulating virus infection/replication. Several compounds or gene silencers disrupting the rotavirus replication cycle at various stages, like virus attachment and entry, host cell lipid metabolism and homeostasis of lipid droplets, RNA transcription and replication, viral protein synthesis, assembly, and release of the virus, have been identified [149]. Antiviral treatment shall serve as a complement to the vaccine. Recently, the following novel antiviral strategies against rotavirus have been developed. These are:
1.Viruses use host machinery to replicate, assemble, and release newly synthesized virions. A host factor, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, limits rotavirus infection by regulating the antiviral proteins IRF1 and IRF7 [150]. The knockdown of the eIF4F complex using short hairpin RNA and CRISPR/Cas considerably enhanced the rotavirus infection. Suppression of the negative regulator of the eIF4F complex and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) obstructs rotavirus infection. These results highlight that the eIF4F complex is a vital host factor suppressing rotavirus replication, demonstrating promising targets for developing a novel antiviral strategy against rotavirus infection.2.
Brequinar and leflunomide, the two inhibitors of the rate‐limiting enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, strongly inhibit rotavirus replication in intestinal cells and organoids [150]. This study suggests that inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis suppresses rotavirus replication, thus depicting a possible approach for antiviral development against rotavirus. Gemcitabine, an anticancer drug, has been found to inhibit rotavirus infection [151]. This activity of gemcitabine is associated with inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis.3.Rotavirus infection induces one of the nucleotides‐binding domain leucine‐rich repeat‐containing receptors (NLRs), NLRP9b, which initiates the formation of the inflammasome in the intestine to prevent rotavirus replication and the harm it causes [152].4.Rotavirus‐induced intercellular calcium waves (ICWs) in intestinal enteroids are mediated by the repeated release of extracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which activates P2Y1 purinergic receptors on nearby uninfected cells. Antagonists of P2Y1 receptors or their knockdown by CRISPR/Cas results in blockage of ICWs. In neonatal mice, blocking the ADP signal lowers rotavirus proliferation, prevents serotonin release and fluid secretion, and lessens the severity of diarrhea [153]. Blocking paracrine signals could represent a target for antidiarrheal pharmacotherapy.5.VP3 has all enzymatic activities (a single protein that integrates all five enzymatic steps activities) required for capping rotavirus mRNA (a critical step for efficient translation of the viral genome) that is synthesized by the viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, VP1. Antiviral medications can be developed more effectively to prevent and treat rotavirus infections due to our increased understanding of the structure and functions of the VP3 protein [154].

Viruses use host machinery to replicate, assemble, and release newly synthesized virions. A host factor, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, limits rotavirus infection by regulating the antiviral proteins IRF1 and IRF7 [150]. The knockdown of the eIF4F complex using short hairpin RNA and CRISPR/Cas considerably enhanced the rotavirus infection. Suppression of the negative regulator of the eIF4F complex and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) obstructs rotavirus infection. These results highlight that the eIF4F complex is a vital host factor suppressing rotavirus replication, demonstrating promising targets for developing a novel antiviral strategy against rotavirus infection.

Since their discovery in 1973, Rotaviruses have been the prominent causal organism of life‐threatening gastroenteritis in young children and calves worldwide. They show high genetic diversity because of genetic rearrangements and hetero‐encapsidation and are considered a potential zoonotic agent. The absence of proper treatment against rotaviral infection has prompted researchers to develop efficacious treatment and vaccination strategies. Strategies like passive immunization, immunobiotics, and single‐chain antibodies (nanobodies) have managed rotaviral‐induced diarrhea. During the last five decades following rotavirus discovery, several vaccines have been developed, most of which are live‐attenuated variants of naturally occurring strains developed after several passages in cell culture or by reassortment between human and animal strains. Of the seven vaccines recommended at the local or global level in approximately 120 countries, the majority of them are monovalent (five like Rotarix, Rotavac, Rotavin, Lanzhou, and RV3‐BB), and two are pentavalent (RotaTeq and Rotasiil). Though two recent WHO‐approved Indian rotavirus vaccines (Rotasiil and Rotavac) have been adopted widely due to their cost effectiveness and decreased cold chain storage, Rotarix is still the most widely used vaccine globally. These vaccines have reduced diarrheal severity and death rates. However, the WHO‐approved live‐attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines have been less successful in preventing severe gastrointestinal disease in low‐income countries than in high‐income countries and have also been shown to increase the incidence of intussusceptions after oral vaccination significantly. Moreover, a vaccine is still unavailable for 89 million children in several developing countries due to its high cost and limited production capacity. This necessitates next‐generation rotavirus vaccines that are cost‐effective, thermostable, injectable (bypass the gut and decrease the risk of intussusceptions), used without age restriction (neonatal doses or boosters), more efficacious in providing high levels of protection regardless of settings across the globe and processed within a short time, are to be developed to accelerate vaccine coverage and access to unvaccinated children and reduce diarrheal related hospitalizations. The next generation non‐replicating injectable vaccines based on the RV proteins subunit vaccines and RLPs (single, double, and triple layered) have been produced in several bio‐factories, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, insect‐, mammalian‐ and plant cells. Besides the advantages and disadvantages of each bio factory, very few studies have expressed more than one rotavirus protein, and plants have emerged as an economical and safe platform since they are readily scaled and have a minimal risk of endotoxin or human pathogen contamination. Nanoparticles have increased the low immunogenicity and stability of subunit vaccines. Plant‐produced rota‐VLPs composed of VP7, VP6, VP2, and NSP4 are tolerated well and induce homotypic immune responses in infants. Bacterially expressed rotavirus ∆VP8* subunit vaccine with P[8], P[4], or P[6] has elicited virus‐neutralizing antibodies in animals on immunization intramuscularly, and vaccine potential has been improved by introducing a tetanus epitope P2 into P[8] or P[6]∆VP8*. Human clinical trials on vaccination with P2‐VP8‐P[8] and plant‐based rota‐VLPs show they are safe and immunogenic and protect against rotavirus in infants. These vaccines are in the pipeline for approval. Developing these parenteral non‐replicating rotavirus subunit vaccines has excellent potential to overcome several problems associated with currently marketed live attenuated rotavirus vaccines and can serve as an effective alternative. Integration of RV with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, CRISPR/Cas, and RG approaches can resolve fundamental issues related to virus–host interactions and effectively develop recombinant viral strains with new genotypes/proteins as safe vaccine candidates in less time without needing prior cell culture. A variety of antiviral compounds disrupting the rotavirus infection have been developed. Nevertheless, none is currently used as an effective anti‐rotavirus treatment. Further research is required to understand the disease pathogenesis and host susceptibility better to develop an effective and sustainable vaccine production, especially in plants.
