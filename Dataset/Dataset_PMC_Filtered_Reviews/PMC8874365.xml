This novel approach is appraised in light of the successful development of vaccines for Covid-19. All relevant aspects of this pandemic are summarized to provide the necessary framework in contrast to leishmaniasis. The presentation is in a side-by-side matching format with particular emphasis on vaccines. The comparative approach makes it possible to highlight the timeframe of the vaccine workflows condensed by the caveats of pandemic urgency and, at the same time, provides the background of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> behind its use as a vaccine carrier. Previous studies in support of the latter are summarized as follows. Leishmaniasis confers life-long immunity on patients after cure, suggesting the effective vaccination is achievable with whole-cell <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>. A new strategy was developed to inactivate these cells in vitro, rendering them non-viable, hence non-disease causing, albeit retaining their immunogenicity and adjuvanticity. This was achieved by installing a dual suicidal mechanism in <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> for singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>)-initiated inactivation. In vitro cultured <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> were genetically engineered for cytosolic accumulation of UV-sensitive uroporphyrin I and further loaded endosomally with a red light-sensitive cationic phthalocyanine. Exposing these doubly dye-loaded <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> to light triggers intracellular production of highly reactive but extremely short-lived <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, resulting in their rapid and complete inactivation. Immunization of susceptible animals with such inactivated <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> elicited immunity to protect them against experimental leishmaniasis. Significantly, the inactivated <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> was shown to effectively deliver transgenically add-on ovalbumin (OVA) to antigen-presenting cells (APC), wherein OVA epitopes were processed appropriately for presentation with MHC molecules to activate epitope-specific CD8+ T cells. Application of this approach to deliver cancer vaccine candidates, e.g., enolase-1, was shown to suppress tumor development in mouse models. A similar approach is predicted to elicit lasting immunity against infectious diseases, including complementation of the spike protein-based vaccines in use for COVID-19. This pandemic is devastating, but brings to light the necessity of considering many facets of the disease in developing vaccination programs. Closer collaboration is essential among those in diverse disciplinary areas to provide the roadmap toward greater success in the future. Highlighted herein are several specific issues of vaccinology and new approaches worthy of consideration due to the pandemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic></kwd><kwd>Leishmaniasis</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Singlet oxygen</kwd><kwd>cell inactivation</kwd><kwd>whole-cell vaccine platform</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><array orientation="portrait"><tbody><tr><td colspan="5" align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1">

Introduction</title><p>Vaccinology, or the science of vaccines, has received a great deal of attention since the beginning of 2020. This is due completely to the prominent role it has played in response to the emergence of COVID-19&#8212;the most severe pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1918. There have been tremendous advances with unprecedented rapidity in all fields of vaccinology, including the basic science of etiological agents, vaccine designs, delivery strategies, and biotechnologies, scale-up manufacturing, clinical trials, rollout strategies, evaluation of human immune response, epidemiology database and analysis, and public health and policies.</p><p>It is an opportune time to assess the question of what we have learned from this unprecedented and overwhelming effort for future implementation in the interest of controlling infectious diseases by vaccination. This is particularly relevant to diseases, which are not as sweeping as COVID-19 but are still significant and widespread to cause localized epidemics. One example among many is leishmaniasis. This disease has been reported to occur for centuries until today, inflicting considerable morbidity and mortality on the human population worldwide, especially in resource-poor countries. One distinctive feature of leishmaniasis is the development of lasting immunity for patients after cure. The causative agents are thus useful, when rendered safe for use, not only as a whole-cell vaccine against this disease but also as a carrier with adjuvant activities or adjuvanticity for effective delivery of foreign protein vaccines against other diseases including COVID-19.</p><p>In this context, we begin by comparing COVID-19 and leishmaniasis in areas with common threads of relevance to vaccinology, i.e., etiological agents, infection and immunity, clinical diseases and managements, epidemiology, control programs, public health, and other areas. Special emphasis is placed on all aspects pertaining to vaccines. The contrast between the two by this comparative approach delineates the success of COVID-19 vaccine development and also provides the rationale of using <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> as a vaccine delivery vehicle. The prospects of advancing <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-based vaccinology along with others are discussed from the perspectives of this comparative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-10-00248"><title>2.

Causative Agents</title><sec id="sec3dot1dot1-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.1.1. Molecular Genetics</title><p><underline>SARS-CoV-2</underline> is an RNA virus of ~100 nm in diameter and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome is a negative strand RNA of ~30 kb, giving rise to a positive copy of the template for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP)-mediated transcription after cell entry [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two large transcripts are generated from the 5&#8242; part of the viral genome using the host transcription/translation machinery to produce polypeptides, 1a and 1ab. The latter contains a bit of the former, resulting from a frame-shift translation mechanism on ribosomes. Both are cleaved proteolytically into functional proteins needed for viral replicative/transcriptional functions. The 3&#8242; part of the viral genome is subjected to discontinuous transcription, which stops at 6 different locations, yielding transcripts of different lengths that merge with the leader sequence from the very 5&#8242; end. The transcripts from these subgenomic RNAs produce largely accessory or structural proteins needed to assemble mature virions for extracellular exit. A total of ~27 proteins are produced by the unique mechanisms described from 14 open reading frames (ORF) of the viral RNA genome.</p><p><italic toggle="yes"><underline>Leishmania</underline></italic> are single-cell eukaryotic protozoa, each 2 to 5 um in diameter in the intracellular stage, causing endemic and sometimes epidemic leishmaniasis. The haploid genome size of these largely diploid cells is in the order of up to 55 mb. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> genomic replication, transcription, and translations share unique features with other trypanosomatid protozoa (see literature cited in [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Each cell contains up to 36 pairs of chromosomes, ranging in size from 30 to &gt;3500 kb. Each chromosome is subjected to Pol II-mediated transcription polycistronically, starting from one or more transcription-initiation or inversion sites, which do not function as promoters. The polycistronic transcripts produced are trans-spliced into functional mRNAs with 5&#8242;- and 3&#8242;-UTRs via the activities of spliceosomes resting on the intergenic regions. Transcription is regulated by the acquisition of miniexon of 107 nt to cap the 5&#8242; end of the spliced mRNAs, and also by the length of their 3&#8242; UTR after splicing for stability. Production of transcripts for abundant proteins relies on gene dosage effect, i.e., the presence of many head-to-tail tandemly repeated gene clusters, e.g., miniexon genes. Such gene clusters are in the chromosomes of both <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> spp. and related <italic toggle="yes">Trypanosoma</italic> spp. in synteny, indicative of their evolution from a common ancestral origin for functional significance. The open reading frames (ORF) of their genes contain no intron for intron/exon cis splicing. There are up to 8000 ORFs in the <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> genome, encoding discrete proteins per cell. Many have no sequence-homologs in other eukaryotes and thus are functionally undefined. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> and other trypanosomatid protozoa each have a single but highly branched mitochondrion. Each mitochondrial genome consists of ~20 copies of maxicircles (10&#8211;20 kb each) and 10<sup>4</sup>&#8211;10<sup>5</sup> copies of minicircles (~1 kb each), which are concatenated and localized in a specialized region of the mitochondrion known as kinetoplast. Transcripts of cryptic genes from the maxicircles undergo extensive RNA editing to create functional mRNAs. Guide RNAs from both circles provide the templates for precise editing. This is a subject of enormous interest but will not be further discussed herein.</p><p>Both SARS-CoV-2 and <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are obligate intracellular pathogens of mammalian cells. Convergent evolution appears to account for the common features they share for the presence of intron-less ORFs and discontinuous transcription. There are very large and obvious differences between the two in the genome size, complexity of genome replication, transcription, and translation, reflective of relative autonomy for <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> and completely host-dependence of the coronavirus.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot2-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.1.2. Primary and Secondary Infection of Host Cells</title><p><underline>SARS-CoV-2</underline>: The life cycle of this virus in their host cells has been under intensive investigation [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (see the video by Britt Glaunsinger). Briefly, the virion&#8217;s spike proteins latch to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors for cell entry by endocytosis. All cells, which bear ACE-2 receptors, are thus theoretically susceptible to infection by this and other related coronaviruses. Viral entry is followed by an uncoating of the virions that involves proteolytic cleavage of participating proteins and membrane fusion events leading to the release of viral genomic payloads into the cytoplasm for activities as described in <xref rid="sec3dot1dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.1</xref>. Several viral proteins from cleavages of the polypeptides are needed to create double membrane vacuoles from rough ER for housing viral replicative and transcriptional complex (RTC). Other viral proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, utilize host cell machinery to produce the positive genomic transcripts for translation. Additional viral proteins are produced, e.g., NSP (non-structural protein)-1 to shut down host cell mRNA translations, including interferon (INF), to inhibit its signaling activities. The structural proteins produced from the discontinuous transcription of the subgenomic RNAs are assembled on the RER membrane. Viral membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins are aligned for packaging the minus strand of the RNA genome produced. Mature virions are then put together for budding off from the membrane into the RER lumen and pass through Golgi for exit from cells by exocytosis via the egress pathway. The details of this infective cycle have been examined in the host cells of coronavirus-targeted organs, e.g., pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and nasal mucous cells [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The timeframe for each viral life cycle is estimated to include ~10 min for cell entry and ~10 h to complete the described intracellular events, yielding 10<sup>3</sup> virions from each infected cell (more than one million virions per person per day). The virions released from the host cells infect additional susceptible cells, accounting for the spread of their infection. Death of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells via apoptotic and/or necrotic pathway is predicted from previous work on related coronavirus [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There has been no clear evidence for the presence of lysogenic stage for coronaviruses, as reported for Herpes viruses.</p><p><italic toggle="yes"><underline>Leishmania</underline></italic> take residence exclusively in mononuclear phagocytes or macrophages, as noted by examining infected tissues from leishmaniasis patients. There is a large body of literature on the study of how <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infect macrophages in vitro [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Briefly, macrophages take up <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> also by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The C3bi-receptor is thought to be the major one, but almost all known receptors of macrophages have been reported to play some roles, depending on <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-macrophage combinations used for the studies. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> ligands for receptor-binding are their surface glycoconjugates [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], including a Zn-metalloprotease of 63 kd (gp63) and a unique lipophosphoglycans (LPG). The roles of additional surface and secretory molecules have been reported to facilitate the infection. The fusion of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-containing phagosomes with secondary lysosomes was observed, providing the initial evidence that <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are phagolysosomal parasites of macrophages&#8212;immune cells whose very function is to pick up invading pathogens for elimination by phagocytosis. This is unexpected but has been substantiated by investigations during the subsequent decades for all <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> species examined in in vitro and in vivo models. It is also consistent with the ability of some species to grow in vitro continuously, in the absence of macrophages, under acidic conditions of pH 5 at the body temperatures of their mammalian hosts. One recent study found <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> localized in the early endosomes by using Rab markers to trace the dynamic of vesicular transport and membrane fusion [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is no question that <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> live in a modified endosome-lysosome vacuolar system or parasitophorous vacuoles of macrophages. As such, <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are warded off from the host cell cytoplasm by a membrane barrier, limiting host-parasite molecular exchanges. On the other hand, fluorescence-tagged macromolecules in the extracellular milieu of infected macrophages were found to enter the parasitophorous vacuoles via the endocytic pathway. Clearly, while <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are intracellular, they remain accessible to soluble and particulate matters present in the extracellular environment and endocytosed by the host cells. Indeed, evidence indicates that infected macrophages ingest hemoglobin, providing heme as an essential nutrient to <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>, which are aerobic cells, but defective in biosynthesis for heme needed for respiration. Clearly, <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> do not depend on the host cell machinery for replication, transcription, and translation. The spread of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> from one host cell to another is not as well-defined as the viral life cycle of infection. There are two possible pathways to account for the spread of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infection in vivo. Heavily infected macrophages replete with <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> may simply bust open, releasing them to infect additional macrophages. The infected macrophages may become degenerated in other incidences, but not lysed. They are thus recognized by macrophages freshly arrived at the scene as senescent cells for disposal along with <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> therein via scavenging phagocytosis. This mechanism of secondary infection is advantageous to <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> by sparing them from the danger of exposure to the lytic factors present in the host body fluids. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> replicate asynchronously at a slow and variable rate in macrophages, making it difficult to estimate the time-lines for the progression of its intracellular life cycle.</p><p>Both SARS-CoV-2 and <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> establish infection in their respective host cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The mechanism for receptor-ligand specificity is well-defined for the coronavirus, accounting for its entry into a variety of ACE-2 receptor-bearing cells. In contrast, the resident host cells of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are specific and limited to macrophages (also dendritic cells for brief residence), but the mechanisms are haphazard, involving multiple ligand-receptor interactions. The coronavirus ends up in the cytoplasm, taking over the host biosynthetic machinery for reproduction. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> live independently in the vacuolar system of degradative pathways of their host cells. These differences account for their varying levels of molecular integration with their respective host cells and in the strategies of their extracellular exit for spreading.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot3-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.1.3. Species and Variants</title><p><underline>SARS-CoV-2</underline> belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which is subdivided into two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are many species of both, created by mutations during their genomic RNA replications in the host cells. They are mostly non-pathogenic or cause very mild enteric or respiratory diseases in humans. Exceptions are those causing more severe diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic (under discussion), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). More contagious and/or more virulent mutants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g., Alpha variant B.1.1.7 (UK first report), Beta variant B.1.351 (S. Africa), Gamma variant P.1 (Brazil), Ipsilon variants B.1.427/B.1.429 (California), Iota variant B.1.526 (New York), B.1.617 double mutant of S. Africa + California, Delta variant B.1.617.2 (India), and Omicron variant (Botswana/Southern Africa). The first three have fewer than two dozen mutations in each, many of which are in the spike protein, responsible for the cell entry of the virus. Some of these mutants are associated with an increased infection of the upper respiratory tract, e.g., Eek (E484K). Other variants appear to interfere with effective immune response, such as the Beta variant. The Omicron variant that emerged at the time of this writing (November 2021) was designated by WHO as a variant of concern with &gt;50 mutations, of which &gt;30 are in the spike protein and others in immunologically important parts of the sequences. These mutations appear to enhance the viral transmissibility or contagiousness and to reduce the efficacy of the vaccines in current use. A variant reported earlier in Angola has many mutations, but they do not seem to increase the disease severity, i.e., hospitalization, fatality, and reinfection rates. US-CDC provides up-to-date information as mutants emerge worldwide (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/</uri>, 11 August 2021).

In the absence of typical meiosis, genetic recombination is characterized as an infrequent occurrence based on an undefined mechanism. Overall, the phylogenetic evolution of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> spp. is not well-understood in relation to their pathological phenotypes, although the diseases are well-defined as clinical entities in most geographical locations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.2. Signs, Symptoms, and Sequelae of the Disease</title><sec id="sec3dot2dot1-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.2.1. The Major Clinical Symptoms</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline> is largely an acute infectious disease. Clinical signs and symptoms emerge 2-14 days after infection, including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Young patients may be asymptomatic or experience a very mild form of the disease, but this may no longer be true for recently evolved new variants. Some of the symptoms listed may persist in some patients for months with additional neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal medical problems known as &#8220;long haulers&#8221; [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Fatal cases are due primarily to respiratory paralysis as a result of pulmonary functional failure, mainly among older patients or those with underlying health problems, e.g., diabetes, cancer, and immunocompromised individuals. Multi-organ inflammatory syndromes (MIS-C) have been reported in some infected children [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p><underline>Leishmaniasis</underline> is a chronic parasitic disease. The onset of clinical manifestations is slow and becomes noticeable weeks or months after infection. The disease is marked by a gradual progression to chronicity lasting for months or years. Asymptomatic cases are common. The severity of the disease depends on the sites of infection or location of infected macrophages, i.e., their confinement to the skin or systemic spreading to internal organs of RES, i.e., spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Simple cutaneous leishmaniasis is marked by the appearance of skin lesions as small papule or plaque, which may remain small, closed, and dry or evolve into wet and open volcanic lesions. Development of secondary or satellite lesions and recrudescence of apparently healed lesions are common, but only in some specific geographic locations. All cutaneous lesions are eventually self-healed spontaneously, indicative of effective immune mechanisms for clearance in most endemic areas. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis also begins with skin infection, but it metastasizes into oropharyngeal and nasal cavities, causing non-healing lesions, with tissue damages and cartilage erosions, resulting in facial disfigurements. All types of tegumentary leishmaniases are non-fatal, but can cause considerable discomforts and morbidity, especially in mucocutaneous cases. Visceral leishmaniasis is an often fatal disease if not treated. Major clinical signs and symptoms arise from inflammatory disorders of hematopoietic and hematological systems, such as fever, lethargy, fatigue, weight loss, cachexia, anemia, lymphadenopathy, leukocytopenia, and hyperimmunoglobulinemia leading to hepatosplenomegaly and bone marrow dysfunctions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot2-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.2.2.

Epidemiology</title><sec id="sec3dot3dot1-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.3.1. Transmission</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline> is an air-borne, highly transmissible infectious disease. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected individuals via their saliva or respiratory fomites, aerosol, droplets expelled by coughs, sneezes, talking, or singing. The virus appears to have jumped from bat to human via an intermediate animal of unknown species [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This view is weakened by the discovery of a bat coronavirus, which infects human cells efficiently by possessing a spike protein with receptor-binding domain (RBD) essentially identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is thus uncertain if COVID-19 is a zoonosis with a reservoir animal to keep the virus in circulation [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to infect many domesticated and captive animals, from pets (cats and dogs) to zoo animals, e.g., pumas, tigers, gorillas, and snow leopards, to farmed mink. Outbreaks in mink farms have already shown that the virus underwent mutations and that the infected animals passed the variants back to humans [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is nevertheless still considered to be low (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html</uri>, 18 November 2021). Infection of the deer populations with human SARS-CoV-2 at high rates raised the alarm in many States, e.g., ~80% of the white-tailed deer population infected in Iowa (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/researchers-detect-coronavirus-in-iowa-deer-69376">https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/researchers-detect-coronavirus-in-iowa-deer-69376</uri>, 3 November 2021).

Humans are incidental dead-end hosts, except in some places where anthroponosis is indicated by the apparent absence of animal reservoirs. Hares and raccoon dogs have been found to harbor pathogenic visceral <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> and are thus potential reservoirs.

The distribution generally coincides with that of the vector sand flies in resource-limited countries of temperate and tropical areas.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3dot3-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.3.3. Incidence</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline>: Its clinical incidences and consequences have been closely watched worldwide as a pandemic. According to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, as of 27 January 2022, there are 364 million confirmed cases with &gt;5.6 million death in &gt;200 countries/territories and &gt;73 million cases with &gt;877,000 deaths in the USA.</p><p><underline>Leishmaniasis</underline>: As a neglected disease, its incidences have not been closely tracked. Annually, the numbers of new cases worldwide are estimated to be 50,000 to 90,000 for VL and 600,000 to 1 million for CL, respectively, according to WHO (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis</uri>, 8 January 2022). These are very rough estimates and are thought to be under-counted by 25&#8211;45% of the actual incidences.

Risk Factors</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline><bold>:</bold> The risk increases with exposure to the virus-contaminated air and with age for severe illness, ranging from requiring hospitalization and intensive care to death, older adults being at the highest risk. People of any age are at risk of severe illness, especially those with certain underlying medical conditions, e.g., heart or lung problems, weakened immune systems, severe obesity, diabetes, and possibly pregnancy [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p><underline>Leishmaniasis</underline>: The risk increases with human activities that increase the exposure of individuals to infected sand fly vectors in the endemic areas. Environmental and climate changes are associated with the risk of leishmaniasis. Epidemics thus often flare up sporadically in endemic regions where forest or arid lands are reclaimed for urbanization and agricultural or industrial uses in developing countries. Risk factors further include metabolic diseases, such as obesity and immunosuppressive conditions that are congenital or produced in cancer treatments and, as required, in organ transplantation or infection. HIV co-infection was a significant risk factor, in southern Europe initially, and is now a concern in other countries, such as Brazil and India. Additional risk factors include natural disasters, such as earthquakes, famine, drought, floods, and the man-made upheaval of war.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.4.

Diagnosis</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline>: All available strategies and technologies have been mobilized to rapidly develop diagnostics with variable specificity and sensitivity for COVID-19, including nasal swap and saliva samples for viral RNA detection by RT-PCR, and nasal/blood samples for detection of viral antigens or antibodies quantitatively by ELISA and qualitatively by dipsticks. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for many diagnostics, including those for self-tests at home. Rollouts of diagnostic tests vary with the strategies of pandemic controls. Under the policy of &#8220;live with the pandemic&#8221; in the western world, diagnosis of the population has been based on making the kits and tests freely available. Under the &#8220;zero Covid policy&#8221; in China, massive populations have been mobilized in the millions for repeated daily tests.</p><p><underline>Leishmaniasis</underline>: Diagnosis of leishmaniasis is limited to those in the endemic areas, relying largely on the microscopic visualization of parasites in infected tissues obtained from diseased skin or organs (bone marrow, spleen).

The biopsied samples are directly examined microscopically or after amplification by cultivation for the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>. Noninvasive diagnosis means are experimentally available to detect either <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-specific antigens or antibodies in saliva or urine.

Clinical Managements</title><sec><title>A. Chemotherapy</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline>: Chemotherapy is currently unsatisfactory. Remdesivir is the antiviral in use to help some patients with mild disease recover sooner. It does not work for all such patients and often does not benefit severely ill patients. Dexamethasone and similar steroids are the only medicines in use to increase the survival rate of patients sick enough to require extra oxygen in ICU. Molnupiravir is another antiviral in clinical trials, showing similar effectiveness or the lack of it. The outcome of its clinical trials released subsequently by Merck showed clear-cut benefits if taken early, prompting FDA to issue EUA for its clinical application. Both antivirals are nucleoside drugs to block viral replication [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Shionogi announced human trials of a 3CL protease inhibitor [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as the first once-a-day pill for COVID-19 patients. Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir tablets (PAXLOVID&#8482;) (Pfizer) with similar properties gained FDA&#8217;s EUA. The difficulty of developing antiviral compounds by blocking virus-specific polymerases and proteases has been discussed [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The antimalarial drug amodiaquine may be re-purposed for use against COVID-19. It was found highly effective at preventing viral entry, as determined by microfluidic Lung Airway Chip or human organ chip microfluidic culture technology [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p><underline>Leishmaniasis</underline>: Current chemotherapy of this disease relies on the use of antiquated drugs, e.g., pentavalent antimonials (sodium stibogluconate, Glucantime, or meglumine antimoniate), amidine compounds (pentamidine), or amphotericin B, which are either not effective or toxic or difficult to administer. The last compound proves effective in liposome format for treating visceral leishmaniasis, but it is not cost-effective for patients in resource-poor countries. Additional anti-leishmanial drugs include miltefosine as an orally effective drug and aminoglycoside paromomycin for topical or internal applications. Chemotherapy of leishmaniasis has become increasingly difficult, resulting not only from using a handful of already unsatisfactory drugs but also because of the development of drug resistance. A combination of different drugs, each at a low dose, is the current approach attempting to circumvent this problem.</p></sec><sec><title>B.

Control Programs</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline>: A remarkable program was set up to fight COVID-19 with tremendous resources of unprecedented scale, i.e., Operation Warp Speed. It was a public/private partnership initiated by the US government to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed</uri>, 13 January 2022). It was officially inaugurated on 15 May 2020 and funded with about $10 billion from the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) passed by the US Congress on 27 March 2020. This is an interagency program involving US-CDC, -FDA, -NIH-NIAID, -BARDA of DHHS, -DOD, -USDA, DE (Department of Energy), and DVA to prioritize COVID-19 for investigation and coordination to expedite all medical, administrative, and logistic needs. Seven biotech/drug companies were chosen to receive funding of &gt;1 billion each in most cases to develop and produce vaccines or therapeutics. The investments yielded two mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech, Pleasant Prairie, WI, USA; Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) and one adenovirus-delivered (Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) vaccine within 1 year time starting from laboratory design to shot-in-the arm inoculation. This is a feat accomplished with amazing rapidity, although the safety and effectiveness of all new vaccines cannot be determined until a large database is established from very wide use for many years. This is also true for all the other vaccines in the pipeline of this program. A spike peptide + adjuvant vaccine (Novavax, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) has cleared Phase III clinical trial. Another adeno-vaccine (AstraZeneca, London, UK/Oxford University, Oxford UK) was successfully produced and authorized for use in &gt;120 countries. The remainders were either in trouble of significant delay (Sinofi, Paris, France/GSK, Brentford, UK) or abandoned altogether because of ineffectiveness (Merck, Durham, NC, USA/IAVI, New York, NY, USA). Progress has been made more slowly for the diagnostics and therapeutics supported by this program. FDA granted EUA (November 2021) for pills of molnupiravir by Merck and Paxlovid (a protease inhibitor) by Pfizer to be taken orally at the first signs of COVID-19 to stave off its severe clinical consequences based on unpublished data of clinical trials by the respective drug companies.</p><p><underline>Leishmaniasis</underline>: National programs were previously launched to control visceral leishmaniasis. One started in 1950 in China, consisting of patient identification for treatments, control of vector sand flies, and elimination of dogs as the reservoir. The program was successfully executed by the allocation of sufficient resources to mobilize medical, public health specialists, and the general public for strict and persistent enforcement of its prescribed measures. Methodical surveillance during the subsequent years showed a total elimination of the disease in a large formally endemic area of eastern China. Today, visceral leishmaniasis occurs sporadically in the western region of Sichuan, Gansu, and Xinjiang. A similar kala-azar elimination program was launched in 2014 to control visceral leishmaniasis in the highly endemic area of India. The program has successfully reduced caseloads significantly. Neither program matches the resources and technologies of Operation Warp Speed for the pandemic COVID-19.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.5. Vaccine</title><sec id="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.5.1. Development, Production, and Application</title><p>A. <underline>COVID-19 vaccines</underline>: The extremely short timeframe for developing multiple formats was made possible chiefly by enormous government funding to provide tremendous incentives to the private sectors. Included in the support are not only vaccine designs and scale-up production before proof of safety and efficacy but also regulatory expedition of the reviews to grant emergency use authorization (EUA). Numerous articles have been published about the development and production of vaccines for COVID-19 [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As of 21st January 2022, WHO lists 334 vaccines in development, of which &gt;190 are pre-clinical and &gt;140 clinical. Listed below are examples of five different formats, of which the first four target spike protein (see <xref rid="sec3dot1dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.2</xref>) as the mono-specific vaccines and three of the five (1, 2, and 5) have already been used widely for vaccination of the general public.</p><p><bold>1. mRNA</bold> (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, CureVac AG, Tubingen, Germany, CanSino, Tianjing, China): Delivery of mRNAs to cells for making disease-fighting proteins has been under study for two decades [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is the newest vaccine platform where mRNAs are encased in lipid nanoparticles for uptake by host cells. Once inside, host machinery is used to synthesize the spike protein or part of it. The mRNAs are then degraded, leaving no trace to cause potential deleterious effects. The most significant advantages of mRNA vaccines lie in the simplicity and rapidity of their design, the ease of its changes and production. The final products also contain a limited number of ingredients. The major disadvantage of mRNAs is their instability, requiring deep-freezing temperatures as low as &#8722;80 &#176;C for storage and the necessity of prompt use after thawing. Administration of 2-doses weeks apart is also costly and cumbersome. Phase III clinical trials yielded 95% efficacy for the mRNA vaccines made by two different companies, providing a high level of confidence for such a new vaccine format.</p><p><bold>2. Adenovirus-delivery</bold> (e.g., AstraZeneca (AZ) or Covishield; Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) New Brunswick, NJ, USA; Sputnik-5, Moscow, Russia; CanSino, Tianjin, China): Adenoviruses have been used for many decades as a vehicle to deliver DNAs initially for gene therapy and then vaccines against a number of viral diseases [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. How to render these viruses non-replicative and thus safe, how to package vaccine-coding genes into its genome, how to mass-produce them in mammalian cells (e.g., Vero, CHO, BHK-21), and how to purify the viruses have all been worked out in great details. These are the major advantages for adenovirus-delivery of vaccines. The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic offers the unprecedented rapidity of completing Phase III clinical trials for these vaccines, yielding variable levels of efficacies up to 100% in preventing hospitalization, severe diseases, and death. The adenoviruses used are mostly those causing the common human cold, except for the AZ vaccines using a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1). The requirement of a regular low temperature of ~4 C for storage of these vaccines is the distinct advantage over the mRNA vaccines. Single-dose administration of the J&amp;J (ad26) and CanSino (ad5) vaccines, based on the outcome of Phase I&amp;II and III trials for efficacy, offers additional advantages of cost-effectiveness and convenience for use in difficult to reach locations. Spunik-5 uses adenoviruses of two different serotypes (Ad26 and Ad5) by Gamaleya researchers for constructing the 1st and 2nd vaccine doses that are designed to avoid the secondary antibody response heightened against the 1st construct, as often seen in prime-boost vaccination scheme [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The major disadvantages of using adenoviruses for vaccine delivery remain to be concerns of their entry into the host cell nucleus as DNA viruses, raising the likelihood of their genomic integration and reshuffling, and reversion to pathogenicity.</p><p><bold>3. Recombinant protein-Nanoparticles</bold> (e.g., Novavax, Gaithersburg, MD, USA): This is based on the commonly used strategy to produce vaccines as recombinant proteins in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> followed by their purification for display on novel nanoparticles for vaccination with adjuvants, e.g., Saponin-based Matrix-M1. The advantages of such vaccines include the use of well-developed biotechnologies and the precedent of FDA approval for similar vaccines as safe and effective for extensive use against other diseases. The disadvantage is the limited ability of peptide subunit vaccines to induce cytotoxic CD8 T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Phase III clinical trials of Novavax spike vaccines appeared to show ~90% efficacy overall and 100% against severe COVID-19.</p><p><bold>4. DNA</bold> (e.g., Inovio, San Diego, CA, USA<bold>):</bold> This platform places mammalian expressible genes in DNA plasmids for transformation of and expansion in <italic toggle="yes">E coli</italic>. Isolated plasmids are delivered into cells of skin or muscles by using a device, which produces electric pulses to create membrane pores to let in the plasmids. Major advantages of DNA vaccines are the rapidity and simplicity of the vaccine designs, the ease of their changes, and mass production based on well-developed recombinant biotechnologies. Stability, easy storage, and cost-effectiveness are also the advantages of DNA vaccines versus mRNAs. The use of DNAs and the requirement of their nuclear entry raise the same concerns similar to those related to the use of adenoviruses or other DNA viruses. An additional concern is the consistency and efficacy of plasmid delivery via electric pulses. Preliminary reports of 2-dose clinical trials for spike DNA vaccines appeared to be safe and effective (&gt;90%). Phase III trials of this DNA vaccine are still ongoing, but the outcome is expected to be ready for submission to FDA for EUA in 2022.</p><p><bold>5. Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses</bold> (e.g., Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India; SinoVac, Beijing, China; SinoPharm, Beijing, China). Many FDA-approved vaccines in current use against infectious diseases consist of the causative agents killed by chemical and/or physical means, e.g., formalin, UV/gamma irradiation, &#946;-propiolactone, and binary ethylenimine. One advantage of using such a time-honored and well-established methodology for making COVID-19 vaccines includes the technical familiarity, facility availability, and reliability of production. Using a complete virus as the vaccine is also advantageous by having a full repertoire of all available viral antigens to optimize immunogenicity [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The disadvantages of this approach include the requirement of expensive and cumbersome P3 safety facilities for obtaining the pathogenic viruses and antigen denaturation by the harsh inactivation conditions used by necessity to ascertain the safety of their application. Both China and India opted to develop such COVID-19 vaccines [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Fully inactivated or &#8220;dead&#8221; viruses are administered in two doses weeks apart. The efficacy was reported to be 78% for India&#8217;s Covaxin and to vary from 50&#8211;90% for the Chinese versions, depending on the sites of Phase III clinical trials.</p><p>All vaccines discussed above, except the last one, are designed to elicit a human immune response for producing antibodies against a single target, i.e., spike protein, thereby inhibiting its binding to ACE-2 receptor to block cell entry of the virus (see <xref rid="sec3dot1dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.2</xref>).</p><p><bold>6. Alternative and improved vaccines</bold>: Below are several examples from a dazzling array of different ideas for vaccine designs. It is contemplated to produce a billion doses of a &#8220;people&#8217;s vaccine of spike protein&#8221; (Peter M. Hotez) by using simple and low-cost technology similar to platform 4, but using yeast cells [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], as has been done to make Hep B vaccines for the last 40 years in India. Available facilities exist to mass-produce flu vaccines in chicken eggs. This is exploitable for COVID-19 by incorporating Newcastle Disease Virus with a highly stabilized spike protein (NDV-HXP-S), which can be engineered by available technologies to withstand heat and chemical denaturation [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Structural biology offers infinite potential to design next generation of vaccines. One example is the &#8220;2P spike&#8221; made by introducing two proline substitutions into the spike protein to keep its structure stable in the prefusion state, thereby significantly increasing its antigenicity for producing more effective neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A first HLA-I immunopeptidome analysis of virally infected human cell lines identified T cell epitopes in out of frame viral S, N, and non-structural proteins, providing new vaccine designs to target infected host cells against variants [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Oral and nasal spray vaccines represent additional formats under investigation. The latter was designed to elicit better immune response at the site of infection.</p><p>B. <underline>Human leishmaniasis</underline>: In contrast, no vaccine of the modern formats has been made available for general use for this disease despite persistent efforts for decades. Easy success was initially predicted because a spontaneous or chemotherapeutic cure of human leishmaniasis is followed by patients&#8217; life-long immunity. A complete list of past preclinical efforts and clinical trials was compiled in detail in 2011 [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Interests in developing vaccines for leishmaniasis have persisted, as indicated by a steady stream of reviews written on this topic [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Readers are referred to these reviews for the history of past successes and failures, and details of the current attempts. It suffices to mention the earliest format of effective vaccination and representative examples of the subsequent efforts.</p><p><bold>1. Leishmanization (vaccination with live <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>):</bold> Inoculating healthy individuals with lesion-derived live parasites in a hidden site is the crudest form of vaccination for prophylaxis of simple cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). This is known as leishmanization [<xref rid="B51-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and has been practiced for millennia to protect individuals from the potentially facial disfiguring CL in the Middle East and Central Asia. The vaccinated individuals develop lasting immunity after self-healing. Leishmanization is thus effective and is still practiced today using avirulent cultured promastigotes as the vaccines in Iran (Ali Khamesipour, personal communication). In central Asia, a large clinical trial of vaccination was carried out by Russian workers with another avirulent strain grown in vitro, resulting in good protection overall. This vaccine was abandoned due to rare incidences of severe skin infection. There have been many preclinical trials in animal models using genetically attenuated or crippled <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> by knocking out essential genes, which are important for cell growth, replication, or virulence [<xref rid="B52-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. None has been developed to reach the stage of Phase III clinical trials.</p><p><bold>2. Vaccination with killed <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic></bold>: Significant attempts were made under WHO sponsorship to carry out clinical trials using cultured promastigotes, which were autoclaved to ensure their safety before use. Autoclaved promastigotes were used at 100&#8211;400 ug per dose with or without alum or BCG [<xref rid="B54-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; F. Modabber Personal communication]. This vaccine format proved safe, but was abandoned for lacking efficacy after extensive trials in the Middle East, North Africa, and South America. Prophylactic activities have been shown in pre-clinical trials in animal models with cultured promastigotes, which were inactivated in vitro by other means, e.g., anti-leishmanial drugs, gamma-irradiation, and heat-inactivation. No clinical trials have been undertaken with <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> killed by these means.</p><p><bold>3. Subunit vaccines:</bold> The best studied subunit vaccine consists of three antigens, which were initially identified by screening <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> expression library with convalescent sera of patients who recovered from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). A trivalent peptide vaccine was subsequently produced in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> as recombinant products of fusion proteins (LEISH-F1+MPL-SE). This vaccine proved effective when used with appropriate adjuvants to immunize susceptible animals against the challenges with virulent parasites in preclinical trials. Clinical trials of this vaccine provided evidence of its safety in Phase I and II [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B55-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], but showed only limited efficacy in Phase III [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], hence no further development for general use. ChAd63-KH is another anti-<italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> vaccine, consisting of two antigens, i.e., kinetoplast membrane protein-11 (KMP-11) and hydrophilic acylated surface protein B (HASPB) in a Simian adenovirus. Its vaccinability is indicated by their pre-clinical trials individually and preliminary clinical trials for immunotherapy of Postkala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in Sudan [<xref rid="B57-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Other subfractional vaccines examined include soluble and/or insoluble fractions of cultured <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> or their secretory products; and other recombinant products of immunologically active <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> antigens. Immunoprophylatic protection of susceptible mice was demonstrated, for example, by immunization with purified LPG, recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> antigenic proteins, e.g., gp63 (zinc proteinase), and <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-receptor for activated kinase (LACK). Few have been submitted to clinical trials in dogs, resulting in the commercialization of four approved for sale in the market as vaccines for canine leishmaniasis, e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> gp63 and A2, a mixture of ribosomal proteins and secretory products of cultured parasites in combination with different types of adjuvants.

There are stringent guidelines to ensure the availability of effective treatments ready for use to terminate the infection at the first sign of an untoward outcome. The ethics of this approach has been the subject of considerable debate. The severity of COVID-19 is considered to outweigh the ethical concern of CHIM, calling for action in an open letter of 14 October 2020 that was addressed to the UK Health authority and signed by a group of &gt;100 scientists and other professionals, including 15 Nobel laureates (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.1daysooner.org/uk-open-letter">https://www.1daysooner.org/uk-open-letter</uri>, 14 October 2020).

The project started in March 2021 with a handful of volunteers isolated inside London&#8217;s Royal Free Hospital. The target subjects are 18 to 30-year-olds free of COVID-19 symptoms and from other risk factors such as heart disease or diabetes. The study aims include tests of how effective vaccines are in warding off infection and symptoms, and how participants&#8217; immune systems respond to the vaccination. It is planned to expand the study to other sites nationwide.</p><p>Another study was started by Dr. Helen McShane, professor of vaccinology, Department of Paediatrics, Oxford University (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-19-human-challenge-trial-launches-study-immune-response-covid-19">https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-19-human-challenge-trial-launches-study-immune-response-covid-19</uri>, 19 April 2021).

While WHO&#8217;s COVAX program is designed to ease this inequality among different countries, its effectiveness is at the mercy of support from wealthy countries. AstraZeneca is the only private company committed to helping resource-poor countries by providing its vaccine at cost. Rapid immunization of the world population is recognized as a matter of necessity to bring the pandemic under control. This has been marred by the inequality of vaccine distribution due primarily to the excessive greed of vaccine companies for profits (except AstraZeneca) as well as to national and diplomatic interests, and racial discrimination of the wealthy countries known as &#8220;vaccine nationalism&#8221;, &#8220;vaccine diplomacy&#8221; and &#8220;vaccine apartheid&#8221;.</p><p><underline>Leishmaniasis</underline>: There is no vaccine yet to roll out, precluding the emergence of confounding issues.</p><p>The inefficient rollout of vaccines negatively impacts their effectiveness by allowing pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in the infected population, especially those unvaccinated for accumulation of potentially transmission-enhancing and/or immunity-resistant mutations. Indeed, there has been the emergence of such variants in successive waves from Alpha to Delta to Omicron and now Omicron subvariants.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5dot5-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.5.5. Socio-Economic Impacts on Vaccination Rate and Herd Immunity</title><p><underline>COVID-19</underline>: The vaccination rate is susceptible, in addition to rollout inefficiency, to a range of known economic, social, and other factors, which have plagued all previous vaccination programs. There are &#8220;vaccine skippers&#8221; uninformed of vaccine availability or living in hard-to-reach locations; &#8220;vaccine hesitants&#8221; fearing needles, vaccine inefficacy or side-effects; &#8220;vaccine skeptics&#8221; doubting the necessity of vaccination; and &#8220;anti-vaxxers&#8221; fooled by the misinformation of vaccine-caused harms. The negative impacts of these groups have slowed the rate of full vaccination in the USA, leveling at ~60% for the vaccination-eligible population of 12 years old and older (since July 2021). Subsequent resurgence of viral transmission with the emergence of delta-variant speaks for the necessity of booster shots. FDA indeed issued EUA for boosters of approved vaccines initially for the vulnerable groups and then for all (November 2021), and for vaccination of children of the 5&#8211;12-year-old age group since October 2021. The overall vaccination rate had not increased substantially for the subsequent 6 months, i.e., 63.7% as of 24 January 2022. Effective mathematical modeling for the threshold of herd immunity has been hampered by these and by other negative factors, e.g., premature abandonment of transmission-averting measures (social distancing, mask-wearing, lockdown) and inefficiency of vaccination to block viral transmission of emerging variants with waning immunity of vaccinated and convalescent populations [<xref rid="B63-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].

The symptoms were manifested 2 weeks after vaccination, starting with severe persistent headache, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pains, blurred vision, tiny blood spots under the skin. Blood clots block veins draining blood from the brain.

The common denominator for both AZ and J&amp;J vaccines is the use of adenovirus to carry the spike gene, raising the suspicion of this virus as the trigger (according to Dr. Eleanor Riley, Immunology/Inf Dis, Univ Edinburgh (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idCNL8N2M64C5">https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idCNL8N2M64C5</uri>, 13 April 2021).

Leishmania Platform for Safe and Effective Delivery of Vaccines</title><sec id="sec3dot6dot1-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.6.1. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> as an Effective Vaccine Platform</title><p>This is suggested by the fact that most patients of leishmaniasis develop life-long immunity after a spontaneous or chemotherapeutic cure. Indeed, memory T cells were reported to persist in subjects long after a full recovery from cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, as they are functionally activatable in vitro with <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-specific antigens [<xref rid="B76-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Clinically, the best example is the simple cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) endemic to central Asia and the Middle East. There, Leishmanization with live <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.1</xref>, II-1) has been practiced as the crudest form of vaccination, reminiscent of &#8220;variolation&#8221; to prevent smallpox. Anecdotal histories of both practices suggest a common root of origin from ancient countries in the East. While leishmanization has been continuously practiced in some locations until today, variolation was abandoned long ago. Both are relatively effective, but the margin of their safety differs significantly. Variolation has a death rate of 2&#8211;3% plus incomplete protection from re-infection [<xref rid="B78-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In contrast, leishmanization has survived the test of time not only for efficacy but also safety by causing no more than simple CL&#8212;a non-lethal, often insignificant and self-healing skin infection.</p><p>Notably, the development of life-long immunity is the exception rather than the rule after recovery from most infectious diseases. Besides leishmaniasis, another example is Q fever in animals and humans caused by a Gram-negative bacterium<italic toggle="yes">, Coxiella burnettii</italic> [<xref rid="B79-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Recovery from a bout of Q fever renders patients forever immune to this disease, as seen in leishmaniasis. The causative agents of these two different diseases are phylogenetically distant but share considerable similarities in the biology of their parasitism. Both <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. burnettii</italic> utilize macrophages as their exclusive host cells by residing in their acidic phagosome-lysosome vacuolar system. Patients who recovered from both diseases are also marked by a strong and lasting antigen-specific DTH (delayed-type hypersensitivity), indicative of the development of T cell-mediated immunity. Natural infection by these etiological agents thus amounts to successful vaccination, indicative of their possession of not only effective vaccines but also functional adjuvants in the context of vaccinology. Of relevance is adjuvanticity, as defined in its broadest sense. Both organisms are endowed with resistant surface glycoconjugates. While different in architecture, they function similarly to protect themselves and, by inference, the natural vaccine molecules they contain from losses, for example, to degradation by lytic factors present in the animal body fluids. The parasitism of macrophages by these agents further brings their endogenous vaccines to the desired destination of the antigen-presenting cells (APC). The subsequent entry of both microbes into the phagosome-lysosome vacuoles also favorably places their vaccine molecules in position to facilitate their proteosomal and lysosomal processing for presentations via MHC Class I and Class II pathways for T cell activation. In contrast to <italic toggle="yes">C. burnettii</italic> as a select agent highly virulent with a resistant phase, <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> is a biosafety level II pathogen and thus a safer choice for development as a vaccine platform. Additional advantages of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> include in vitro cultivability of these protozoa in a chemically defined medium free of animal sera for mass production in fermenters and its well-developed transgenic technology to express foreign vaccines with ease [<xref rid="B81-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6dot2-vaccines-10-00248"><title>3.6.2. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are Made Safe as a Vaccine Platform by Installation of a Dual Suicidal Mechanism for Singlet Oxygen-Initiated Inactivation</title><p>Live <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> can be an effective vaccine platform, as shown by their use for Leishmanization (see <xref rid="sec3dot6dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.1</xref>). As such, its clinical applications have limits. For example, leishmanization results in the formation of skin lesions, which may on rare occasions become protracted, requiring weeks to heal even in healthy individuals with apparently intact immune systems. Leishmanization is off-limits to those who are immunologically deficient congenitally or due to immunosuppressive infections, e.g., HIV or under immunosuppression after organ transplantation.</p><p>A new approach was devised to render <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> totally non-viable and thus non-disease-causing with minimal loss of their adjuvanticity. Their use as a vaccine platform is thus not only effective but also made safe. A dual light-activatable suicidal mechanism was installed in <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> to achieve this (<xref rid="vaccines-10-00248-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A&#8211;C). We first exploited its natural genetic deficiencies of missing the genes coding for the first five enzymes in the pathway for porphyrin/heme biosynthesis. Promastigotes were genetically engineered in vitro with mammalian cDNAs to express delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD) and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the 2nd and 3rd enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway [<xref rid="B82-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B83-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. These transgenics accumulate UV-sensitive uroporphyrin I cytosolically when exposed to delta-aminolevulinate (ALA)&#8212;the product of the 1st enzyme in this pathway. The absence of downstream enzymes after PBGD accounts for the cytosolic accumulation of uroporphyrin I to a very high level. The uroporphyric <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> were then further loaded endosomally with a red-light sensitive phthalocyanine, which was chemically engineered for cationicity to facilitate endocytic uptake [<xref rid="B85-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Light excitation of these <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> cells loaded with both dyes results in generating abundant singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) in both cytosolic and vacuolar compartments [<xref rid="B82-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B87-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. These radicals are highly reactive to oxidatively inactivate cellular proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. However, only those in the immediate vicinity of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation are affected due to the extremely short lifespan of these radicals (half-life in microseconds). Indeed, the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generated endogenously in the cells vanishes too rapidly to travel across the plasma membrane, thereby leaving the surface glycoconjugates intact to serve the adjuvant functions, as described (<xref rid="sec3dot6dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.1</xref>). Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are not susceptible to extracellular <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generated in the milieu, accounting for the necessity of their dye-loading followed by light excitation to produce intracellular <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> for effective inactivation. The reactions of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> with intracellular biomolecules trigger the generation of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) secondarily, including hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>.</sup>), peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and superoxides (O<sub>3</sub>). The contribution of these ROS to the inactivation of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> is considered limited on account of their neutralization by a multitude of highly active endogenous antioxidant enzymes. These antioxidants are known to exist abundantly in <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>, e.g., peroxidases, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin, and trypanothione reductase. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> neither produce <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> nor encounter these radicals in the environments of their natural life cycle. Hence, they have not been subjected to selective pressures to evolve a specific mechanism for <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> detoxification. Only plants are known to have evolved the potent mechanism by strategic placement of beta-carotene and tocopherol to scavenge <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> produced in the chloroplasts during photosynthesis. The absence of this or other potent free radical scavenging mechanisms in <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> accounts for their sensitivity to internally generated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> as the principal inactivating agent.

The initial evidence for this was provided by exposure of dye-loaded <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> to light for <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-inactivation before and after their loading of antigen-presenting cells (APC), e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro [<xref rid="B84-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The uroporphyrinogenic mutants load macrophages as readily as the wildtype control, indicative of their full efficacy in delivering vaccines to APC. Exposure of the mutant-laden macrophages to ALA induced a transient porphyria of these host cells when using cell lines, e.g., J774, but not primary mouse macrophages. In both cases, the intracellular mutants become highly uroporphyric and persistently remain so. A host-parasite porphyric disparity is thus created so that light exposure of these macrophages after infection selectively inactivates <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> for disintegration in the parasitophorous vacuoles (PV), leaving the host cells unscathed. The disappearance of the PV ensues in these cells, concomitant with their return to normalcy from <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-mediated immunosuppression, as shown by microarray analysis of their global transcription profiles [<xref rid="B89-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].

One is the immunotherapeutic potential of the inactivated ENO1 transfectants [<xref rid="B93-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Vaccination of BALB/c mice with these inactivated transfectants after implantation of murine ENO1-positive lung cancer cells prevented the development of otherwise massive tumors in their peritoneal cavity. This immunity is adoptively transferable with splenic cells to significantly reduce the tumor development of human ENO1 lung cancer cells in immunosuppressed mice. A similar but less dramatic effect of such vaccination was noted against tumor development in the murine pancreatic cancer model.</p><p>Another example is the preliminary observations of the investigation still in progress with inactivated <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and membrane proteins. In two independent studies, immunization of C57BL/6 mice was shown to elicit the generation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells responsive to activation by the peptide antigens in vitro. These immune cells are specific to the viral antigens, as clearly indicated by the completely negative readings of the control transfectants without the transgenes. This is remarkable, considering that both spike and membrane transgene products must be rather small in quantity versus the large amounts of many different <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> proteins, i.e., up to 8000 proteins known or expected from the total ORFs of the <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> genome (see <xref rid="sec3dot1dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.1</xref>).

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-vaccines-10-00248"><title>4.1. Prospect of Disease Control from the Perspective of COVID-19 Pandemic by Vaccination and Beyond</title><p>What transpired most clearly from this comparative analysis is the possibility of making multiple vaccines available for use very quickly in an emergency, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Precedence is thus set for the potential to do the same, in principle, for all infectious diseases, preferably before they turn epidemic or even pandemic. There is evidence that global warming accelerates this event for many diseases [<xref rid="B94-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], including leishmaniasis with the sign of its northward expansion. Leishmaniasis is just one of the 20 different diseases targeted by WHO for elimination. While none is pandemic, together they cause significant mortality and morbidity. The incidences of these diseases are limited mainly to low- and-middle income countries (see <xref rid="sec3dot3dot3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3.3</xref>), making it unlikely to garner the kind of lavish support as Operation Warp Speed (see <xref rid="sec3dot4dot4-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.4.4</xref>). The necessity of developing vaccines against all these diseases is, however, evident [<xref rid="B95-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], especially for zoonoses, like leishmaniasis or those emerging periodically from wild animals, like COVID-19 (see <xref rid="sec3dot3dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3.1</xref>). All infectious diseases with wild animal reservoirs are impossible to eradicate, requiring constant attention to mitigate their resurgence by costly preventive measures (see <xref rid="sec3dot4dot3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.4.3</xref>) and surveillance (see <xref rid="sec3dot4dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.4.1</xref>). Vaccine development for these diseases becomes all the more urgent due to the lack of effective drugs and drug resistance (see <xref rid="sec3dot4dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.4.2</xref> A&#8211;C).</p><p>While all events associated with anti-Covid vaccines are still unfolding, indicative of the enormity and uncertainty of such undertaking, invaluable information has been made available at a rapid pace to inform those who are interested in such a bench-side to bed-side endeavor for fighting diseases. Also made evident by the pandemic-related work is the relatedness of vaccination to many facets of the disease, requiring expert input from disparate disciplines in line with the concept of the &#8220;One medicine, One health, One-world&#8221; approach. Attempts are thus made by covering all pertinent aspects of both diseases for comparison with the recognition of inevitable omissions. In the same vein, topics for further discussion are broad-based but selective to highlight and elaborate specific points of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-vaccines-10-00248"><title>4.2. The Success of Anti-Covid Vaccines Provides Impetus to the Development of New Approaches in Vaccinology </title><p>The new approaches include <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> Vaccine Platform (see <xref rid="sec3dot6dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.1</xref>, <xref rid="sec3dot6dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.2</xref> and <xref rid="sec3dot6dot3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.3</xref>). The mRNA and adenovirus for delivering vaccines (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.1</xref> A) are both a novelty, although they are based on biotechnologies after refinements by extensive investigation for decades [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mono-specific vaccines of both platforms were produced, solely containing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2&#8212;an apparently ideal vaccine target, considering the critical role it plays in the entry of virus into the host cells (see <xref rid="sec3dot1dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.2</xref>). Indeed, vaccinated individuals were shown to produce infection-blocking anti-spike antibodies, which were found, however, to decrease in titers with time and in activities against emerging mutants (<xref rid="sec3dot5dot6-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.6</xref>) (see <xref rid="sec4dot4-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 4.4</xref> for further discussion). Specifically, both Delta and Omicron variants were found to replicate in and disseminate for transmission from the vaccinated. However, they were still protected from severe illness, hospitalization, and death, suggestive of the development of antibody-independent immunity. The absence of pulmonary pathology among the vaccinated is thus thought to result from the activities of vaccine-activated CD8+ T cells, which swoop in to lyse virally infected cells, thereby limiting the infection to the upper respiratory tracts. If so, <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-based delivery of spike protein has the potential to strengthen such CTL activities for lasting immunity, as discussed (see <xref rid="sec3dot6dot3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-vaccines-10-00248"><title>4.3. The Successful Deployment of Adenoviruses as a Platform for Anti-Covid Vaccines Makes the Use of Leishmania for Vaccine Delivery all the More Conceivable</title><p>Various adenoviruses genetically engineered to cripple their replication have long been explored as vaccine carriers against a myriad of significant diseases, e.g., SARS, Ebola, Zika, influenza, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria [<xref rid="B96-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic offered the best opportunities for clinical trials to assess various adenovirus carriers, e.g., J&amp;J, AZ, Sputnik-5 (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.1</xref> A2), not only for their safety but also their efficacy. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> rendered non-viable by installing a double suicidal mechanism (see <xref rid="sec3dot6dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.2</xref>) compares favorably in safety margin versus the live albeit replication-deficient adenoviruses. While <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are far more complex than viruses structurally and composition-wise as eukaryotic protozoa, the mode of their parasitism is highly specific and marked by many elements of subtleties and stealth. Indeed, leishmaniasis is thought to have evolved from a long history of host-parasite interactions for their mutual adaptations. This is suggested by the extant niche of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> endoparasitism, alternating between the sand fly guts and the phagosome-lysosome vacuoles of mammalian macrophages (see <xref rid="sec3dot1dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.2</xref> and <xref rid="sec3dot3dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3.1</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> exploit the endocytic mechanisms of these phagocytes for entry as their exclusive host cells, taking reclusive residence in their parasitophorous vacuoles; in contrast, pathogenic viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, break into multiple cell types and take over their biosynthetic machineries for viral replication (see <xref rid="sec3dot1dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.2</xref>). The adenoviral vectors are rendered non-replicative but still deliver vaccines in a similarly invasive way. <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> are non-toxigenic pharmacologically and elicit no acute host immune response, and so, much as certain cutaneous species, have been used as live cells for human vaccination in Leishmanization (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.1</xref> B). Such immunogenic and adjuvant properties of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> can now be preserved by genetic and chemical engineering to render them totally non-viable by light-inducible <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> inactivation (see <xref rid="sec3dot6dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.2</xref>). These leishmanial vectors thus possess favorable features of safety and efficacy for vaccine delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-vaccines-10-00248"><title>4.4.

Coupled with the natural vaccines known to exist endogenously in <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>, such transgenic is a de facto chimeric vaccine suitable for immunization against both COVID-19 and leishmaniasis. The <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-inactivation of such a chimeric vaccine is equivalent to, but better than, combining both pathogens inactivated separately by chemical or physical treatments (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.1</xref> A5). Inactivation of whole pathogens by these means invariably diminishes their vaccinability, as rigorous conditions are often required by necessity to ascertain safety.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-vaccines-10-00248"><title>4.5. Complementary to the Current Mono-Specific Anti-Covid Vaccines Is Perhaps the Use of Leishmania Transfectants Expressing Spike Protein Together with One or More Additional SARS-CoV-2 Antigens</title><p>Waning immunity and breakthrough cases of those immunized with the available monospecific vaccines are accountable, for the most part, by the mutations of the spike proteins in the emerging variants. This is well-known concerning molecules of all pathogens at the interface of host-parasite interactions. Frequent mutations of the spike protein increase the chance of their selection by immune pressures for the best fits to evade humoral immunity. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref rid="sec3dot1dot3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.1.3</xref>) have emerged successively with an increasing number of mutations over the earlier versions in their spike proteins, e.g., up to 18 in the Delta-variant and &#8805;32 in the Omicron-variant. The Delta-variant became less susceptible to neutralization by previously made spike protein-specific monoclonal antibodies and by polyclonal antibodies in the sera from mRNA vaccinated cohort [<xref rid="B99-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="B100-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], accounting likely for the ease of its transmissibility or contagiousness. The Delta-variant infection was indeed reported to produce elevated viral loads by as much as 10<sup>3</sup> fold higher than those produced by the prior variants. The Omicron-variant is predicted to be even more transmissible and more vaccine-resistant, as reported from the preliminary studies by the British government scientists.</p><p>Mutations of spike proteins alone do not fully explain all the events observed, e.g., no severe clinical sequelae despite the heavy viral loads and the emergence of inflammatory immunopathology long after the infection is over (<xref rid="sec3dot2dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2.1</xref>). These phenomena are reminiscent of the <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> model for virulence [<xref rid="B101-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref rid="B102-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], depicting separate groups of molecular determinants independently responsible for distinct phases of disease progression from infection to immunopathology to resolution. Independent up- and down-regulation of these functionally different molecules may thus produce a spectrum of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to mild to severe cases in discordance with the pathogen loads [<xref rid="B101-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>].</p><p>Vaccination with <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> delivery of multiple antigens has the potential to foster the effectiveness in preventing the development of all signs and symptoms of COVID-19, irrespective of spike protein mutations. Of particular interest is to determine if a single dose of a multivalent vaccine is sufficient to elicit lasting immunity by this approach, mimicking the outcome of leishmanization (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.1</xref> B). The emergence of mutants in successive waves seen with increasing resistance levels appears to make the vaccine formulation with spike protein alone unsustainable. Simply administering more booster shots of the same or sequence-revised vaccines is not expected to outrace the force of natural selection for the best-fit spike protein. There is, in fact, no scientific rationale against the development of multivalent vaccines from the very beginning, regardless of the platforms used.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-vaccines-10-00248"><title>4.6. COVID-19 Pandemic Has Brought Several Important Areas of Vaccine-Related Research into Focus for Attention</title><p>(1) Foremost perhaps is the significance of the ongoing active investigation of clinical samples for elucidating human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot6-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.6</xref>). Such efforts provide crucial information for real-world verification of the laboratory findings obtained at the cellular level in vitro and with animal models in vivo.</p><p>(2) The initiation of &#8220;Human challenge trials&#8221; is made possible by the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.3</xref>), akin to controlled human infection model (CHIM) already used to screen drugs/vaccines for their safety and efficacy against some infectious diseases [<xref rid="B103-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The pandemic urgency may further incentivize technical breakthroughs to further reduce the risk of this model for regulatory compliance so that it can be used to study areas of significance directly related to human infection and immunity. One area of special interest for such investigation in CHIM is the mechanism of animal-to-human transmission of pathogens. The outcome is expected to shed light on how different pathogens jump from animals to humans relevant to the source of their origin, e.g., SARS-CoV-2. Such investigation also has the potential to explain different outcomes of pathogens&#8217; animal-to-human transmission, e.g., highly airborne transmissibility of the virus to cause catastrophic pandemic COVID-19 versus <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>&#8217;s vector-transmission to cause wide-spread endemics of cutaneous leishmaniasis with limited severity (see <xref rid="sec3dot3dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3.1</xref>). Another area of interest to study in CHIM (and in clinical trials) is the post-chemotherapy-immune response of the volunteers to the therapeutically killed pathogens in situ. Since no drug or treatment is expected to reach everywhere in the body to eliminate all targeted pathogens, immune clearance of the residual pathogens has long been considered a mandatory step for the &#8220;clinical cure&#8221; of infectious diseases after therapeutic intervention. The outcome has the potential to help design vaccines and drugs that are more effective than those in use (see <xref rid="sec3dot4dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.4.2</xref> A). Pathogens assessed as weak in vaccinability may have them strengthened by using <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>-based delivery of their vaccine candidates (see <xref rid="sec3dot6dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.1</xref>,<xref rid="sec3dot6dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.2</xref> and <xref rid="sec3dot6dot3-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.6.3</xref>).</p><p>(3) Of utmost importance are several unanswered questions relating human immunity to pathogenic infection, i.e., exactly how pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2 or <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic>, initiate human infection to cause their respective diseases, how the vaccines designed against them elicit a human immune response, and why the longevity of immunity against re-infection varies. It has long been thought that the outcome of human immunity to infection is determined at the first moment of host-pathogen/vaccine interactions and the dynamic events after the first encounter at the cellular and molecular levels in situ. These events have defied scrutiny in the real world. Real-time imaging and time-lapsed sample collections present technical and ethical hurdles for investigation in CHIM.</p><p>The closest available model for such studies is the in vitro simulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by lung organoid chip/microfluidic approach [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The novelty of this model is the design with an artificial basement membrane lining with epithelial cells outside facing the airway passage and with endothelial cells inside facing the microfluidic blood flow. The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to the airway initiates the infection used for studying its progression and also the response to various soluble factors and immune cells loaded to the circulating fluid phase. In vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells provides different cell types needed for such models. Microfluidic organs-on-a-chip of 3D cell cultures are available for other tissues. They are suitable for investigating pathogens with different portals of entry, e.g., skin, liver, colon, and brain. Time-lapsed imaging is possible, and samples are collectible from such 3D models for omics studies. Meta-analysis of the omics data is within reach by computation with the assistance of AI and machine learning programs. Information from such organoid models can integrate with one another, CHIM, and patients&#8217; clinical data to elucidate human infection and immunity.</p><p>It is feasible to apply this approach for elucidating individual variabilities to specific infections/vaccination. This is ultimately in the domain of research for personalized medicine. Acquisition of information from individualized 3D-organoid models is highly desirable. The outcome will have considerable potential to define individual differences in responses to a given infection or vaccine, thereby explaining the wide spectrum of disease clinical signs and symptoms (see <xref rid="sec3dot2dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2.1</xref> and <xref rid="sec3dot2dot2-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2.2</xref>) and uncovering unforeseen rare, but severe, consequences of vaccination, e.g., VITT (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot7-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.7</xref>). The accomplishment of such feats in the future is thus expected to delineate individual disposition of a given infection, i.e., asymptomatic, mild cases, severe illness or death, as well as to vaccination, e.g., intensity and longevity of the immunity. Inching toward that aim is perhaps recent progress in completing human genome sequencing whereby &gt;100 additional protein-coding ORFs were identified [<xref rid="B104-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Considerable more advances are still needed for contemplating the approach mentioned toward a full understanding of individual variations in infection and immunity.</p><p>Acquisition of knowledge in human infection and immunity is indispensable to provide precise information so that scientific experts, healthcare officials, and political leaders can make the right policies rapidly and accurately for vaccination of the population and to convince the general public of its value to combat vaccine hesitancy, skepticism, and anti-vaxxerism (see <xref rid="sec3dot5dot5-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-10-00248"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>While COVID-19 is a disastrous pandemic, it has energized the scientific community to rise to the occasion by making tremendous progress and contributions to blunt its ferocity, if not yet stop it completely. All past pandemics ended after running their courses, presumably via the selection of the best-fit hosts with more robust immunity and of pathogens for attenuation toward avirulence. The scientific victory to aim for is thus not to stop the pandemic, but to mitigate or minimize its destruction, for example, the human death tolls. By that measure, remarkable progress has been made by lowering the pandemic death of the world population to 0.07% for Covid-2019 (5.62 million/~8 billion as of 26 January 2022) from up to 5.4% for the 1918 Spanish flu (17&#8211;500 million), and up to ~50% for the Black Death during the 14th-century Medieval period and the Byzantine Empire (541 C.E.). What has contributed most is undoubtedly the availability of multiple anti-Covid vaccines completed in record time for world immunization. The mRNA vaccines capture the brightest aura in the spotlight as expected in this era of synthetic biology. Still, all anti-Covid vaccines await the test of time for their true effectiveness, like all vaccines previously developed and deployed. The persistence of COVID-19 serves as a reminder for the imperfection of the vaccines in use (<xref rid="sec3dot5dot1-vaccines-10-00248" ref-type="sec">Section 3.5.1</xref> A).
