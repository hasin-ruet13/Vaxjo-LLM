Currently, the COVID-19 outbreak has fueled an international demand in the biomedical field for the mitigation of the fast-spreading illness, all through the urgent deployment of safe, effective, and rational therapeutic strategies along with epidemiological control. Confronted with such contagious respiratory distress, the global population has taken significant steps towards a more robust strategy of containment and quarantine to halt the total number of positive cases but such a strategy can only delay the spread. A substantial number of potential vaccine candidates are undergoing multiple clinical trials to combat COVID-19 disease, includes live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored based, sub-unit vaccines, DNA, mRNA, peptide, adjuvant, plant, and nanoparticle-based vaccines. However, there are no licensed anti-COVID-19 drugs/therapies or vaccines that have proven to work as more effective therapeutic candidates in open-label clinical trial studies. To counteract the infection (SARS-CoV-2), many people are under prolonged treatment of many chemical drugs that inhibit the PLpro activity (Ribavirin), viral proteases (Lopinavir/Ritonavir), RdRp activity (Favipiravir, Remdesivir), viral membrane fusion (Umifenovir, Chloroquine phosphate (CQ), Hydroxychloroquine phosphate (HCQ), IL-6 overexpression (Tocilizumab, Siltuximab, Sarilumab). Mesenchymal Stem Cell therapy and Convalescent Plasma Therapy have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 virion. On the other hand, repurposing previously designed antiviral agents with tolerable safety profile and efficacy could be the only promising approach and fast response to the novel virion. In addition, research institutions and corporations have commenced the redesign of the available therapeutic strategy to manage the global crisis. Herein, we present succinct information on selected anti-COVID-19 therapeutic medications repurposed to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, this review will provide exhaustive detail on recent prophylactic strategies and ongoing clinical trials to curb this deadly pandemic, outlining the major therapeutic areas for researchers to step in.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd><kwd>acute viral respiratory distress syndrome</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The world has confronted the global outbreak of several epidemics and pandemics caused by unknown coronaviruses (CoVs). Regardless of the immense advances in biomedical research, this century has been challenged with the frequent emergence of novel invading pathogens known to pose major and vulnerable alterations in the public healthcare system with a long-lasting dent in the global economy. In December 2019, the global human population experienced the drastic havoc of a deadly spillover i.e., coronavirus pandemics, elicited by the contagious SARS-CoV-2 pathogen (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). The clinical condition aroused by the phenotypically and genotypically diversified SARS-CoV-2 with the worldwide crisis has been officially announced as the current &#8220;COVID-19&#8221; threat by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020a</xref>). The first epicenter responsible for pneumonia of unknown etiology was the wholesale seafood market in Wuhan city, China (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Phelan et al., 2020</xref>). Shortly, mounting infection statistics dramatically inflated with a high degree of fatalities in all nooks of the world. The incidence of ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is very rapid and violent, and from December 2019 to October 2020 has surpassed 72.7 million confirmed cases and more than 1.6 million fatalities.</p><p>Universally, mature SARS-CoVs (Nidovirales order) are the enveloped, positive-sense ((+)ss), and non-segmented RNA viruses with the largest linear genome of &#8764;32&#160;kb (<xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>); (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). They are spherical virions with a diameter of around 100&#160;nm. In general, a virus has a capsid, which acts as a shield to protect the viral genome. In addition, the protein capsid of SARS-CoVs is surrounded by lipids. The family Coronaviridae, are divided into &#945;-CoVs, &#946;-CoVs, &#948;-CoVs, and &#947;-CoVs genera (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Al-Qahtani et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is the world&#8217;s third-worst hit emerging &#946;-CoVs following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) with a broad spectrum of disease severity, ranging from mild fever (88%), fatigue (40%), dry cough (69%) to severe, life-threatening multiple organ complicacies (conjunctivitis, encephalitis, etc), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), dyspnea, septic shock, tissue hypoperfusion and death (<xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2020b</xref>). As per clinical data, a patient&#8217;s especially the elderly suffering from diabetes, asthma, chronic coronary artery disease, hypertension, and so forth are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Lovato and de Filippis, 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). The estimated median incubation period for COVID-19 is on an average between 2 and 14&#160;days after natural exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The common mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virion from person-person is primarily <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> respiratory droplets or through direct aerosolization of secretions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>); (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Shanmugaraj et al., 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf and Lessler, 2017</xref>); (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Killerby et al., 2020</xref>). However, there is a pressing need to design novel and broad-spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic medications not only to combat COVID-19 disease but also to counter the wide class of pre-existing resistant infectious virions and their mutants to rescue the global population from multiple life-threatening diseases.</p><p>The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic shares a high degree of similarity with SARS-CoV in key genes, as evidenced <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> genomic sequencing as well as decade-long scientific analysis correlated to their proximal origin (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). The whole RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for structural (spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M), and the envelope (E)) proteins, and non-structural proteins (Nsps) critical for its survival and virulence power. The nucleocapsid of &#946;-CoVs is composed of a major structural phosphoprotein i.e., N protein-laden within phosphorylated lipid bilayers and is encased by two discordant S proteins; surface-exposed S glycoprotein trimmers which are present virtually in all SARS-CoVs and the hemagglutinin-esterases shared solely in some SARS-CoVs (<xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Scotti and Scotti, 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Forni et al., 2017</xref>); (<xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020b</xref>). The S protein is a glycosylated multifunctional molecular machine that promotes virion internalization into a target cell and is the sole viral membrane to determine viral tissue tropism and host range to some extent. The unique presence of these club-shaped peplomers or spikes on the surface of the virus, give SARS-CoV a crown-like appearance when viewed under a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">Velavan and Meyer, 2020</xref>). S1 and S2 subunits of &#946;-CoVs S protein play a crucial role in the recognition of cell surface receptor and membrane fusion, respectively. The former contains two functional RNA binding sub-domains: the C-terminal domain (CTD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD). The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV implicated in recognition of host cell unique signatures (receptors) is localized in the CTD (<xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2017</xref>). But not all coronavirus RBDs are located in the CTD, the receptor of MHV (Murine Hepatitis virus) is CEACAM1 (not sugar), and its RBD is located in S1-NTD. NTD and CTD mediate the binding of the virion to sugar-based receptors, and the protein-based receptors, respectively (<xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). The M protein maintains the membrane structure of coronavirus whereas the E proteins contribute to the assembly and release of virions including their pathogenesis (<xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>). SARS-CoVgenetic makeup contains 5&#8217; and 3&#8242; terminal sequences, featuring a gene order 5&#8216;&#8211;replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1ab-S-E-M-N-3&#8216; (<xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020b</xref>); (<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). CTD of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the metallopeptidase functional receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) to enter permissive cells, overall similar to SARS-CoV, whereas CTD of MERS-CoV binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). According to recent findings, the TMPRSS2 (serine protease-2) receptor also primes SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the target epithelial cells. These corresponding molecular interaction studies have been determined <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the crystal structure of the protein complex (<xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020c</xref>). The complex between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 forms the first line of infection, the most common therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the key molecular target involves: 1) Blockade of SARS-CoV-2 spike by the administration of recombinant soluble ACE2, which plays the role of decoy receptors to trap the virus and, thus, to inactive virion internalization into the host cellular cytoplasm; 2) administration of specific antibodies by vaccination that specifically interacts with the S protein and blocks ACE2; 3) inhibition of host proteases to handicap SARS-CoV-2 and prevents its entry into the permissive cells (<xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et al., 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2020b</xref>). Accumulating clinical evidence on human tissue specimens has discovered the active ACE2 expression in the kidneys, epithelial cells of lungs, vascular endothelium, liver, small intestine, and the nasopharynx (<xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Hamming et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of molecular interaction between virus and host cellular receptors.

Furthermore, specific molecular targets of the virus might change or acquire resistance to the existing vaccines and drugs, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate.</p><p>Confronted with such a pandemic, the present century highlights the crucial demand for the discovery of neoteric therapeutic interventions to fight against the deadly pneumonia virus (SARS-CoV-2). In this scoping review, we will explicitly stress upon currently available antiviral measures in accordance with their pharmacological and therapeutic effect (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In particular, in this comprehensive review, we discussed the current understanding of how HLA genetic variation plays a crucial role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 patients at a high risk of infection. In addition, the emphasis has been given to the real-time development of vaccines along with the global response towards the ongoing clinical trials which in future endeavours will have the potential for prophylaxis of the novel viral pathogen.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Targets, Mechanism of action, required dose, safety profile, and improvements of repurposed anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Targets</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mechanism</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dose and usage</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Limitations</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Improvements</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Favipiravir</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RdRp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Targets RdRp and inhibits viral transcription and replication mechanism</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of treatment-5&#160;days. 1,800&#160;mg twice (day 1) followed by 800&#160;mg twice (day 2&#8211;5).</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Teratogenic in nature</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Works effectively in the form of combination therapy with Chloroquine and Azithromycin</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Remdesivir</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RdRp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nucleotide analog that halts viral genome replication</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Corse of medicine-&lt;10, 200&#160;mg (day 1) and 100&#160;mg for the following days <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> intravenous instillation.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Respiratory failure, organ impairment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lymecycline</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral survival proteins</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Restricts the production of viral proteins essential for survival</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">408&#160;mg, 1&#8211;2 capsules twice a day&#160;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No side effects</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Telmisartan</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ACE2 receptor</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blocks angiotensin receptor</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80&#160;mg/12&#160;h</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No registered side effects</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lopinavir</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3CL<sup>pro</sup>

The common strategy to mitigate virion docking into a host cell is to actively target viral key elements i.e., RBD (center for therapeutic approaches) of S protein (inhibit entry of virion into target cells). Recently, Elfiky et al predicted the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-binding site with Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78), a cell surface signaling receptor. Their molecular docking perspective revealed that there is favorable binding between the III and IV region of the S protein model and GRP78. Region IV serves as the major traction force for GRP78 binding. Moreover, these nine residues can be clinically valuable to develop <italic toggle="yes">de novo </italic>therapies effective against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Ibrahim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Nsps are known to mediate multiple mechanisms needed for viral replication and transcription machinery including host-virus interaction. For SARS-CoV-2, ORF1a/b encodes two co-terminal replicase poly-proteins- pp1a and pp1ab. These replicase poly-proteins are subsequently cleaved by proteases to form individual Nsps. Nsps3 and Nsp5 encodes two coronaviral cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>), respectively for producing remaining Nsps. Nsps are also involved in the synthesis of viral RNA, for example, Nsp12, also called RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) is a conserved protein among coronavirus responsible for virus transcription and replication complex. Nsp8 acts as a primer for Nsp 12-RdRp RNA synthesis whereas the Nsp7-Nsp8 complex increases the affinity of Nsp12 to bind RNA and precede transcription and replication machinery. Hence, clinically approved enzyme inhibitors targeting these replicase proteins may exert anti-COVID-19 activity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> for therapeutic development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Drugs/Nucleoside Analogs Associated Therapies for Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Clinical</title><p>To date, no effective anticoronavirus medications have been approved. However, there are large numbers of potential clinical studies taking place worldwide to examine the therapeutic capability of specific anti-viral drugs, vaccines, and antibodies based on the genomic and biophysical understanding of SARS-CoV. For example, determining key targets of SARS-CoV-2 may design small molecule inhibitors acting upon the functional proteins or enzymes associated with the virus replication cycle. Humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and fusion/peptide inhibitors may function as promising anti-COVID-19 drugs by targeting the S1 RBD and the S2 subunit, respectively <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020d</xref>); (<xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>). These target-dependent therapeutic strategies offer numerous options for the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> discovery of anti-SARS-CoV candidates. Another strategy is also developed by boosting the human innate immune response, which plays a significant role against SARS-CoV. Maximum drugs developed to treat other infectious diseases are currently repurposed for clinical trials. Currently, clinical trials are specifically indulged in identifying combinatorial drug therapy that can be categorized into broad-spectrum specific host and virion based therapies. Nsps, a significant functional protein of SARS-CoV are ultimately involved in RNA replication, transcription, processing, protein synthesis, translation, membrane modification, and host infection. Among them, PLpro, 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, and RdRp are the most attractive and viable anti-SARS-CoV targets for the discovery of specific peptide inhibitors and small-molecule drugs to curb COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host cellular receptor (ACE2). Later, virion particles gain entry into the target cells and undergo endocytosis. Inside the cell, due to low endosomal pH, the virus capsid disintegrates and the virion genome is released in the cytoplasm for protein synthesis mechanism. After the release of genomic RNA, it undergoes translation and replication forming sub-genomic mRNAs. The latter translates into a variety of structural (S, E, M, and N) proteins and accessory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RNA genome and a variety of cellular proteins undergo the formation of a new virus particle in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).

Favipiravir directly targets the cleavage of RdRp blocking virion replication machinery and inhibiting infection. In contrast, Tamiflu, a potential inhibitor of neuraminidase blocks sialic acid (also called as neuraminic acid) catalytic site and the successive internalization of the virion into the host body. Unlike Tamiflu, favipiravir apparently lacks in the generation of resistant viruses (<xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Shiraki and Daikoku, 2020</xref>). This best feature of favipiravir offers a novel therapeutic potential for treating the resurgence of SARS-CoV. However, the efficacy of favipiravir and interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) (ChiCTR2000029600) composites have been tested on COVID-19 patients to evaluate the synergistic enhancement of host immune response and virion inhibition.

Favipiravir was combined with an antiviral agent, baloxavir marboxil to improve the healthcare complications of patients infected with COVID-19 pneumonia (<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Lou et al., 2020</xref>). Wan and coworkers have evaluated that high dose-response of favipiravir strongly decreases the virion load effect (<xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). Pharmaceutical major Lupinon on August 6, 2020, launched favipiravir, under the brand name &#8220;Covihalt&#8221; (Rs 49 per tablet) to ameliorate the healthcare crisis of SARSCoV-2 infected patients.

They function as a double-edged sword as they are very effective in the treatment of cancer, asthma, auto-immune conditions, and so forth. Lipophilic corticosteroids bind to intracellular corticosteroid receptors (CR) and the complex translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the complex binds to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) and leads to increased gene transcription of several anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-&#946; (<xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">Ramamoorthy and Cidlowski, 2016</xref>); (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Barnes, 2010</xref>).

As per other studies preliminary data, the administration of corticosteroid did not show any beneficial effects on lung injury. Consequently, high-dosage leads to serious adverse complications such as mood swings, avascular osteonecrosis, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis, etc. Although this anti-inflammatory candidate has been reported as a routine treatment of COVID-19 pandemic to combat the extent of inflammation associated with an injury, their use is a point of major controversy, and clinical validation prior to medication administration is highly warranted. Concerning this, 14 clinical research trials have been conducted till date to validate the safety profile and long-term efficacy of the dexamethasone (a cortisol derivative) for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 and heavy death toll.

After that, the UK government authorized dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, no sign of clinical improvement was recorded in moderate and hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Abs are primarily categorized into monoclonal Abs (mAbs) and polyclonal Abs (pAbs) and is recommended as a major class of biotherapeutics to neutralize the antigens/pathogens (bacteria and virus), aiding in their destruction. Passive immunization recognizes the antigenic determinants of a foreign antigen and stimulates an immediate immune response against it. Igs can be produced both by natural (isolation from blood) and artificial means (in the lab). Patients who recovered from SARS-CoV infection showed robust neutralizing Abs response against this CoV. mAbs specifically bind to distinct domains of MERS-CoV S protein, including six distinct epitope groups, and interact with the three critical entry functions of the S protein of MERS-CoV: membrane fusion, sialic acid-binding, and receptor binding (<xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Widjaja et al., 2019</xref>).

The S1 subunit of the S protein contains the RBD which binds to the host receptor. RBD of S protein corresponds to the 74 amino acids involved in the ACE2 receptor binding domain that allows the novel coronavirus to infect human cells. The S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion and the mode of entry similar to other coronaviruses (<xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).

The receptor (ACE2) forms the genomic hallmark explaining the pathogenesis of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. As per clinical findings, binding of S protein with cellular ACE2 leads to the negative induction loop hence, ultimately resulting in ACE2 downregulation. This relative downregulation of ACE2 activates angiotensin I (AGI) towards its specific enzyme i.e., ACE, which on the other hand elevates the levels of AGII. Once AGII binds specifically to AGTR1A (receptor), capillary permeability is increased. The structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is shown in the figure along with the RBD. The protein structure was extracted from PDB (PDB ID-6VSB). The interaction of RBD with the ACE2 receptor of humans is also obtained from the protein database (PDB ID-6MOJ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Spike interactions with the ACE2 receptor of the host.

Combination therapy of mABs and remdesivir was clinically suggested as a perfect therapeutic option for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (Cohen, 2020).</p><p>Tian and colleagues reported the potent <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> activity of mAbs (CR3022) in blocking the interaction of S protein RBD with ACE2 (<xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2020</xref>). CR3022 (anti-SARS-CoV antibody) was originally isolated by the Crucell Holland B.V. (Pharmaceutical company, 2006) in Netherland. Another study reported that CR3022 isolated from the COVID-19 patient interacted with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD at a site different from the ACE2 binding site indicating cross-reactivity of the antibody for having similar structural regions on the S proteins of both the CoVs (<xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>). A well-defined interaction interface forms between CR3022 and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 with no interference between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. However, CR3022 binds to RBD, only when RBD is in the &#8220;up&#8221; conformation. CR3022 Fab specifically binds to SARS-CoV RBD with greater affinity as compared to SARS-CoV-2 due to the presence of non-conserved residues in the epitopes. The potential polytherapy of neutralizing CR3014/CR3022 controls immune escape and extends the protection breadth possibly with a reduced economic cost. Unfortunately, other mAbs directed for SARS-CoV RBD (230, m396, and 80R) didn&#8217;t show any positive response against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to this pitfall, CR3022 can be recommended as a multifaceted therapeutics against COVID-19. In addition to CR3022, mAbs (F26G18, F26G19, S230) also functions following a similar mechanism. Another potent anti-SARS-CoV S1 pAb T62 that showed a potential inhibitory strategy against SARS-CoV failed to produce a similar lethal effect towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Wang and coworkers reported potential neutralizing activity of human mAb 47D11, which specifically targets a conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Additionally, TCZ (Actemra) is a recombinant humanized mAbs (IgG1 class) designed for the inhibition of inflammatory protein IL-6, thereby it could dampen the excess secretion of cytokines that may cause long term damage to the lung. As per findings, a threefold increase in IL-6 levels was reported in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, various IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab) are under clinical investigation in China for anti-SARS-CoV-2. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. recently initiated the first clinical trial of REGN-CoV2 (the cocktail of dual Ab (REGN10933 + REGN10987)) for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. The placebo-controlled clinical trial included four separate study populations: COVID-19 patients (hospitalized), symptomatic COVID-19 patients (non-hospitalized), asymptomatic subjects (healthcare workers), and asymptomatic individuals in close contact with a COVID-19 patient (housemate). Another Ab, S309 showed potent neutralizing activity towards the SARS-CoV-2 virion by specifically targeting the S protein RBD. In addition, the therapeutic activity of S309 as monotherapy or in combination with S309 containing Ab cocktail, may provide a potential clinical insight for defeating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virion in high-risk individuals (<xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This therapeutic mechanism works against COVID-19 as these patients suffer a lot from a cytokine storm.

Even though mAbs have been clinically established as an excellent therapeutic option against COVID-19 in high-risk individuals, the expensiveness, time-consuming production, and the lack of commercially available mAbs either for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV marks the limitation of a successful therapeutic approach (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Shanmugaraj et al., 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">AminJafari and Ghasemi, 2020</xref>).</p><p>NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells) is a protein complex localized in the cytoplasm that plays a key in cytokine production.

However, passive immunotherapy directed administration of convalescent plasma therapy can be another viable and powerful therapeutic strategy to treat critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (<xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>); (<xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Liu, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Virion replication and transcription process can be blocked by clinically exploiting Abs/nanobodies which can easily diffuse through the membrane of virus-infected cells and could potently interfere with the pivotal proteins, such as PLpro, 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, and Nsps responsible for the lethal infection (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Seesuay et al., 2018</xref>). Recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should have a maximal level of pAbs produced by the immune response to curtail new rounds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the administration of convalescent plasma therapy (FDA approved) i.e., successful plasma transfusion from a recovered patient to an infected patient would eventually improve the clinical conditions of virus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza (H5N1, H1N1), Ebola) infected persons with miscellaneous symptoms and inhibit viremia with the overall reduction in the mortality rate. Based on the existing evidence on plasma transfusion therapy, researchers showed the neutralization of novel SARS-CoV-2 (isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) in an infected patient with early administration of hyper-immune immunoglobulin (convalescent plasma) from immediately recovered patients with simultaneous declination in viral loads (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020c</xref>).

The problem associated with convalescent plasma therapy is the significant variability of potency in the recovered patient&#8217;s sera for antigen neutralization, making it a less viable therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This underlying principle deceives novel SARS-CoV-2 virion under the aegis of decoy receptors (also known as cellular nanosponges). Here, virus-infected host cells are intentionally targeted and designed purposefully to combat the virus (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Gershoni, 2008</xref>). Cellular nanosponges look like a small polymer-based nanoparticle core efficiently laden within the viral cell membrane displaying receptors similar to the host cell. IL-1R is identified as the first peptide decoy receptors followed by the DcR1, DcR2, and DcR3 of the TNF receptors superfamily (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">McLachlan, 2020</xref>). In general, the infection causing SARS-CoV-2 latches onto the unique proteomic signatures specifically present on the host cell membrane. Once inside the human body, SARS-CoV-2 releases the RNA genome followed by hijacking the host cell. But interestingly here cellular nanosponges deceive SARS-CoV-2 and deviates its path. When the contamination begins inside the human body, the virus interacts with the pseudo receptors (substitute to actual human receptors), and thereby averts further promulgation of the infection. The underlying postulate of this approach shares close proximity with competitive inhibition where decoy receptors fight against the virion by luring it away from cell receptors (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Linsky et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p>To date, cellular nanosponges are of two types i.e., alveolar epithelial type II cells (also known as &#8220;Epithelial-NS&#8221;) and macrophage nanosponges (also known as &#8220;M&#934;-NS&#8221;). The respective cellular nanosponges were reported to possess invincible antiviral protection to the lungs. In a recent investigation on COVID-19, the PLGA-based nanosponge laden within the membrane of lung epithelial cells were administrated in mice models <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> intratracheal instillation. After three days, a persistent number of blood cells were observed with no evidence of vascular lesion formation or tissue injury. Further, a clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of epithelial-NS and M&#934;-NS. As a result, this report unveiled the equipotency of both cellular nanosponges in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Natural ACE2 receptors present in the lungs and kidneys not only perform the duty of acting as a gateway for SARS-CoV-2 infection but also regulate blood volume and lowers blood pressure. However, during viral sepsis, these biological activities are altered due to viral interference (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ameratunga et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, a designed decoy receptor can reinstate these biological activities, leaving the normal ACE2 receptors conducive for their business. Decoy therapy has been approved in compliance with the FDA for several inflammatory and immune-related diseases such as joint pain, inflammation of eyes, recurrent fever, and so forth. This therapy is considered as a novel, promising, and efficient countermeasure to SARS-CoV-2 virus, obstructing COVID-19 spread (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Inal, 2020</xref>). Recently, a European based Biotech Company; Apeiron Biologics designed an ACE2 decoy for clinical trial study in June 2020 to ensure patient safety with ARDS and pulmonary arterial hypertension <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> intravenous administration. Further, the study demonstrated a tolerable safety profile with minimal known side effects. Another attempt was made by researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in July 2020. They reported that heparin, an anticoagulant, bind specifically to SARS-CoV-2 and acts as a promising decoy to outwit the virus. In the wake of this evidence, more clinical trials can be explored based on decoy receptors to efficiently fight against the COVID-19 pandemics. However, the ultimatum task is to ensure targeted delivery without fail.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>HLA Genetics and COVID-19</title><p>For meeting the therapeutic demand against coronavirus, the infective host should possess excellent genetic background (as HLA) that triggers antiviral response because impairment of immunological responses further led to an increase in the virus load in the organs (e.g., kidney, intestine) rich in ACE2 expression (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell et al., 2009</xref>). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene group in humans encodes HLA-A, -B, and -C markers. The HLA molecules are prototypical candidates that help the immune system to recognize the body&#8217;s own proteins in contrast to proteins of infectious invaders. They elicit an immune response by binding to the peptides of viral invaders. According to the latest investigations at the University of Geneva (Switzerland), researchers demonstrated HLA variation using bioinformatics analysis to identify those that bind firmly to novel SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Furthermore, the HLA complex was categorized based on how easily they bind to SARS-CoV-2 peptide depending upon the resistivity and susceptibility of the population towards the novel pathogen. As per immunologists, T-cell mediated antiviral responses are associated with different HLA haplotypes with the occurrence of distinct disease susceptibilities. In fact, specific HLA haplotypes have a strong association with susceptibility to influenza, tuberculosis like infectious diseases. The four H1N1 virus infections (HLA-A*11, HLA-B*35, and HLA-DRB1*10) are significantly associated with HLA class I in man, therefore confer increased susceptibility to A(H1N1)pdm09 (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Dutta et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, there is an urgent need to elucidate the specific HLA loci related to the development of protective immunotherapy against COVID-19 pneumonia. Nguyen et.al demonstrated a comprehensive in-silico analysis showing how HLA variation affects cellular immunological response against peptides of coronavirus. However, the authors predicted HLA B*46:01 with the fewest binding peptides for coronavirus-2, whereas HLA-B*15:03 was identified with a higher capability to present conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides to immune cells (<xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>).

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) has gained substantial attention due to their efficiency and simplicity. It consists of a guide RNA (gRNA), specific for a DNA or RNA sequence, and a CRISPR associated protein (Cas9). The guide RNA attaches to the complementary target RNA and Cas9 cleaves it, knocking the intended cellular target. The underlying mechanism functions with the degradation of the intercellular viral mRNA (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Dara and Talebzadeh, 2020</xref>). The &#946; family of coronavirus consists of an ssRNA genome of 26&#8211;34 Kb which codes for various structural and Nsps. Naoumov et al, reported the involvement of Cyclophilin (Cyp) protein of the ubiquitous family in the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. They are a set of peptidyl-propyl-isomerases (PPIases) that functions as chaperones and assists in protein folding, trafficking, and activation of B-cell and T-cell. Cyp inhibitors like CsA, have been observed in various studies by <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo-Lozoya et al. (2014)</xref>. Knockout or knockdown of CypA using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology adversely affected the critical replication process of &#945;-coronaviruses, feline coronavirus, the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV). Therefore, it was proved that coronavirus replication was directly linked to CypA (<xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>). This inhibitory property was also studied in different cell lines of HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV by <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Wildjaja et al. (2019)</xref>. Strong impediment of equine arteritis virus replication and a modest decrease in the growth of MERS-CoV in Huh7-CypAKO cells on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology was observed (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Nalawansha and Samarasinghe, 2020</xref>).

Two highly conserved regions of the RDRp gene in the open reading frame1 a/b or ORF1 a/b region responsible for viral proliferation and packaging have been recognized that can serve as potential targets for the PAC-MAN approach. In another study, <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al.

Belonging to the parvovirus family, it is known for co-infection with other viruses (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Naso et al., 2017</xref>). As a current regimen, it has been proven effective against inhibition of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) calcium-permeable ion channel of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Earlier studies in various preclinical models of lung edema have shown protective medication of virus-mediated vaccine by efficiently targeting the TRPV4 receptor. Hence, the rationale behind AAV therapy is to protect the alveolo-capillary barrier by initiating target mediated treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection to lessen the pressure on healthcare systems reliable upon invasive ventilator assisted respiration. TRPV4 maintains the integrity of alveolo-capillary barrier along with the regulation of alveolar macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes which on activation leads to barrier disruption by releasing proteases, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Kuebler et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, Phase I clinical trials have been initiated for validating the safety and efficacy of GSK2798745 (TRPV4 inhibitor) in healthy human volunteers and in lung edema patients.

Strategic application of this therapy can lessen the global burden of deaths which is highly challenging at this point.

In humans, TLR-3 and TLR-7 are destined to recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus particles respectively suggesting the role of TLR-7 in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent activation of TLR-7 leads to the nuclear translocalization of transcription factors like NF-kappaB, interferon regulatory transcription factor-3 (IRF-3) and -7 (IRF-7) along with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, -6, TNF-&#945; and type-1 interferons i.e. IFN-&#945;, -&#946;, all responsible for viral clearance. The mechanism to escape the immune system by SARS-CoV suggests a similar mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 also i.e. <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> induced inactivation of TNF-receptor-associated factors (TRAF) -3 and -6, which are key elements for the activation of IRF-3 and -7.

Though the activation of TLR-4 is bacterial dependent, a hypothesis suggests that the activation of TLR-4 in SARS-CoV-2 may be achieved due to the presence of oxidized phospholipids which can trigger TLR-4 activation. SARS-CoV-2 increases the concentration of Neutrophil myeloperoxidase, an enzyme that oxidizes the phospholipids present in alveolar sacks of lungs into oxidized phospholipids leading to strong activation of TLR-4. Hence, TLR-4 possesses the ability to trigger IL-6 production, and TLR-4 agonists like Tocilizumab can be used to target against COVID-19 disease (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Felsenstein et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Another study suggests that the immunomodulation of TLR-5 not only prevents the cytokine storm but also activates the immune response against COVID-19 disease. Cytokine storm is commonly reported in SARS-CoV-2 patients, which occurs due to the increased expression of cytokines like IL-6 and rapid recruitment of innate cells like neutrophils due to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and increased concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 2020</xref>). NETs restoration and reduced ROS population can be achieved by Deoxyribonuclease 1, which also helps in TLR-5 modulation. Along with this, the newly developed subunit recombinant vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 contains coronavirus-S1 subunit which is an agonist to TLR-5. A clinical trial of phase II carried out involving 162 volunteers with hepatitis B, proved the efficacy of vesatolimod in combination with other antivirals, with clear signals of increased IFN-stimulated gene mRNA expression with a safety profile. This was also validated for its effect in SARS-CoV-2 patients using combination therapy. Similarly, another drug by the name Eritoran tested in an Influenza mouse model, showed improvement in clinical symptoms, reducing the oxidized phospholipid and cytokine levels and mortality (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Biswas and Khan, 2020</xref>).

The immune response generated by this method lasts for a longer period (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahn et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the antigenic material undergoes the process of endocytosis by the immature DCs, hence presenting the antigenic material to the MHC2 and MHC1 antigens expressed on the surface CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively which further leads to the stimulation of active adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Hobernik and Bros, 2018</xref>). One such nucleic acid-based vaccine designed for SARS-CoV-2 was endorsed as &#8220;INO-4800&#8221; by Inovio Pharmaceuticals. It is cost-effective, highly stable at room temperature, storage resistant, and is easily purified. Several factors should be taken into consideration like the route of administration, the amount of plasma delivered, and the adequate interval of time during vaccine administration.

Therefore, the development of a peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 S protein might serve as a safe alternative (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Lucchese, 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Baruah and Bose, 2020</xref>). There are various epitopes of S protein that are computationally predicted using in-silico approaches. Experimentally configured peptide epitopes obtained from COVID-19 patients by screening for neutralizing antibodies proved the existence of useful epitope regions. Recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LII) in this regard. Peptide-based vaccines share an advantageous position due to ease of vaccine design, faster validation, and rapid manufacturing. These vaccine formulations can be obtained as peptide plus adjuvant mixtures or peptides that can be administered by a specific nanocarrier or be encoded by a nucleic acid.

Several potential adjuvants have been identified for designing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>). Some of the common vaccine adjuvants are alum, MF59<sup>TM</sup>, Montanide ISA51, Deltalin, TLR3, Protollin, CoVaccine HT<sup>TM</sup>.

After 6&#160;weeks it was observed that the mouse generated large quantities of IgG antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2. Also, the amount of antibody produced by the vaccinated mouse and recovered COVID-19 patient were strongly correlated in terms of producing neutralizing antibodies. This vaccine also underwent several testing for SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and MERS-CoV and was effective to a considerable extent. The vaccinated mouse was recorded to have a high concentration of cytokines (IFN-&#947;) as stated by the ELISpot quantification report. Also, high levels of IL-6, MIP- 1&#946;, RANTEs, IFN-&#946;, and IP-10 were found in the blood serum of the mouse. High-dose dependent delivery induced large titers (&gt;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>ng&#160;ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) of neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice which is quite high as compared to subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These vaccines can be subjected to improvement by tailoring their immune profiles for disease specificity. Recently, a dual-targeting vaccine has been designed against Hepatitis B virus (HBV) using the target-specific dendritic cells and macrophages. As per the study in a chronic HBV mouse model 74, the vaccine reported the increased efficacy of viral clearance (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Corbett et al., 2020</xref>).

Scale-up production of a particular vaccine requires a delicate balance between cost and quality. For e.g., in vector-based vaccines, the replication becomes defective due to the absence of all essential antigenic parts of the virus. The challenge lies in manufacturing these vaccines with high yield, removing the impurities, and economic production (<xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Saha et al., 2020</xref>). The world-wide distribution also poses a challenge due to the lack of thermostability of the vaccines. Generally, vaccine requires refrigeration with temperature +2 and +8&#176;C but some vaccines require even lower temperature which is difficult to fulfil in developing and also in developed countries. Due to this reason, lyophilized vaccines have gained attention to a greater extent. The outcome of the vaccine response is directly dependent on the route of administration (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Iqbal Yatoo et al., 2020</xref>). The unique property of the vaccine is independent of the dosage, rather gets affected by the route of its entry into the host. For eg, a subunit vaccine by the name &#8220;Nasalflu Berna<sup>&#174;</sup>&#8221; which was administered along with an adjuvant and an active heat-labile toxin (LT) from <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> was reported to cause facial paralysis. When administered through nasal route it generated Th1 immune response but this was not effective in suppressing the viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs therefore was withdrawn from market early. Hence, commercialization of nasal vaccines becomes difficult. The need of the hour is development of a special delivery device for nasal vaccines. An alternative to this approach was the use of a nebulizer but it showed a reduction in virus titer after delivery. Therefore, delivery of vaccines <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> injections delivery is generally preferred for COVID-19 vaccines (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Iqbal Yatoo et al., 2020</xref>); (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Begum et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Current Ongoing Approaches to Tackle SARS-CoV-2</title><p>Vaccine development is the culmination of complex, perilous, and expensive processes incorporating clinical development in the beginning, followed by process development and finally terminating with assay development. The vaccine race in India was evident by the triumphant sanctioning of BBVI52 or Covaxin on August 2020 and ZyCoV-D (Expected to release in 2021). Indigenous Covaxin was launched by Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) after its final approval by DCGI on July 7, 2020. It was procured from a strain of SARS-CoV-2 isolated by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune. It initiated phase-1 clinical trials across the country in July 2020 and the results assured the safety of the vaccine after testing in 375 volunteers from 12 different sites. It successfully cleared the Phase 2 clinical trials which were conducted in 19 cities and in 10 different states of India seeking permission for its phase 3 trials on October 2, 2020. Zydus Cadila Healthcare Ltd traded the second vaccine under the label &#8220;ZyCoV-D&#8221; which went for the first phase of human clinical trials in July. After safely crossing the phase 1 trial across different countries it is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trial. These two Indian vaccine candidates have undergone successfully <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> clinical evaluation in rats, mice, rabbits with minimal known side effects, and reduced toxicity. This paved the way to start an early phase human trial under the approval of DCGI. Russia became the first nation to complete clinical assessments of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on humans, and the results have proved the effectiveness of the medication. It was denominated as &#8220;Sputnik V&#8221; in homage to the world&#8217;s first satellite, which is expected to launch in October 2020 by the Soviet Union. The formula was devised by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow in coordination with the Russian defense ministry. It is based on a proven viral vectored vaccine against adenovirus that is administered in two doses each carrying an S-antigen of the novel SARS-CoV-2 that enters the human cells and produces an immune response. It emerged as the first registered vaccine against COVID-19 after successful completion of phase 1 and 2 trials and is currently undergoing Phase 3 trials in India after collaboration with Dr. Reddy&#8217;s lab with the distribution of 100 million doses of vaccine. The strategic collaborated approach of AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford proposed the global development and distribution of the University&#8217;s potential recombinant vaccine intended to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The product was endorsed as a potential vaccine certified as ChAdOx1 COVID-19, by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, at the University of Oxford. ChAdOx1 COVID-19 used a viral vector based on a weakened version of the adenovirus containing the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. After vaccination, S protein is produced, which primes the immune system to attack SARS-CoV-2 on the first encounter in the body. The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to elicit a vigorous immune response by suppressing the viral replication after administration of a single oral dose that terminates ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus were administered to more than 320 people starting from July 2020 to date and recorded as safe and well-tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as flu-like symptoms and so on. It is one of the top eight vaccines being approved for human safety that is currently undergoing a Phase 2/3 trial. The Serum Institute of India would initiate delivery of the candidate vaccine at less than Rs 250/- per dose in India. The Pune-based institute partnered with Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will offer up to 100 million doses, with the price capped at $3 for 92 low and middle-income countries including India. The outcome of its trial in monkeys revealed its protectiveness from viral pneumonia but cannot subside individuals from acquiring infections. Also, no significant difference in the amount of viral RNA was reported between vaccinated and unvaccinated monkeys. Thus, it was considered as a candidate that can decrease disease severity but not acquiring of infection. Novel Bnt162b1 vaccine was designed by Pfizer and BioNTech, incorporated nucleoside-modified RNA, that is required for the production of large amounts of antigen and robust immune responses is anticipated to be released by 2021. It also encodes the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, a key target of virus-neutralizing Abs. Brazil, the nation with the second-highest number of coronavirus cases, reached an agreement to safeguard doses of the Oxford vaccine with AstraZeneca. Japan has signed up with Pfizer and BioNTech to provide 120 million doses of their vaccine and will be procured by October 2020. Clinical evaluation of its phase 1 and phase 2 trials generated a positive response. It is considered to be safe, efficacious in generating antibodies, and well-tolerated. Japan is also inking deals with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax to provide doses of their coronavirus vaccine. Newly, Sinovac Biotech has innovated a vaccine candidate that underwent interventional and observational pre-clinical evaluation <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and has flourished gracefully in producing IgG Abs. Another non-replicating virus vaccine, under the trademark &#8220;AZD1222&#8221;, was developed by Oxford University, UK was under Phase2/3 and in Phase 3 trials in South America and Brazil, respectively on July 20, 2020. It stimulated the production of neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated host. The human trial of this vaccine candidate was paused for a few months after an individual developed neurological symptoms and adverse reactions. It resumed its trials in October after confirmation of its safety by MHRA in UK. CanSino Biologics of China thrived for a non-replicating COVID-19 vaccine endorsed as Ad5-nCoV is prepared to begin phase 3 clinical trials in Russia. Phase 1 trial started in April 2020 and generated a positive response. However, adverse reactions were found in very few individuals. Later on, it successfully cleared Phase 2. Siberian Vector Institute of Russia used the platform first developed for Ebola to develop the second Russian vaccine against COVID-19 which is under the Phase 1 trial. The UK government has signed a coronavirus vaccine deal with two drug giants GlaxoSmithkline (GSK) and Sanofi, to secure up to 60 million doses of an experimentally treated vaccine. The vaccine developed by Sanofi in partnership with GSK is based on the recombinant protein-based technology to produce a flu vaccine, as well as GSK's established pandemic technology. It is currently under phase 1/2 trials and is expected to move to Phase 3 by the end of 2020 if the results are positive. Also, BCG vaccines and Plant-based vaccines are developed by research institutes of Australia and Canada which are undergoing randomized trials. On December 5, Zydus Cadila has been approved by Government to initiate the phase three clinical trial of its biological therapy. The company has last month announced the successful completion of phase two clinical trial of its PEGylated Interferon alpha-2b biological therapy called &#8220;PegiHep TM&#8221;. The company has stated that the open-label, randomized, comparator-controlled study was conducted on 40 adult patients with moderate COVID-19 disease. Of these, 95% of subjects in the test who received a single dose of PegiHep TM along with the standard of care (SOC) became virus-free as assessed by RT-PCR on day 14, compared to only 68% those who only received SOC becoming RT-PCR negative.

This can effectively control viral transmission and reduce the number of incidences. Countermeasures to SARS-CoV-2 infection demands rapid testing, contact tracing, self-isolation of the infected individuals, and rapid antibody tests to identify asymptomatic cases.

In the meantime, Convalescent plasma therapy and Mesenchymal stem cell therapy have gained substantial therapeutic attention as a remedial measure for the treatment of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Special attention should be provided in terms of therapeutics to the most vulnerable group, including healthcare individuals, children below 5&#160;years, and old age people during this global pandemic. Pivotal implementation of telemedicine and online platforms for some months can contribute towards rapid prevention. COVID-19 disease directly targets the immune system which is a complex network of cells and proteins that defends our body against foreign invaders. Therefore, herbal therapeutics associated with immunomodulatory properties can be used as combinatorial prophylactic and adjunct therapeutics with chemical drugs to attain a positive synergistic strategy to combat this widespread pandemic of COVID-19. The foremost serious focus should be laid on several ways to boost the natural defense mechanism of the body i.e., by taking supplements with immune-boosting potentials such as neem, tulsi, astragalus, curcumin, and gingerone, and so forth. Globally ongoing clinical trials are being launched for validating the safety profile, efficacy, and therapeutic activity of these novel therapeutic herbal immunomodulatory agents. Detailed knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 molecular pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, and pathology are requisite to safeguard human life and reduce fatalities. Adapting to the &#8220;new normal&#8221; can lessen the economic burden on the world and prevent future pandemics. The rat race to develop efficacious therapeutics has united the whole world to combat COVID-19.</p><p>Recent reports from the clinical trial studies of four potential vaccine candidates have shown safe therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 virion by eliciting an active immune response. Pfizer&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162Bb2) is found to be more than 90% effective based on initial trial results in 43,538 human volunteers with no safety issues. This vaccine is based on synthetic mRNA with a storage temperature of &#8722;70&#176;C (ultra-cold) or below. India currently doesn&#8217;t have a system that can deliver such a vaccine, because the cold storage network of India&#8217;s universal immunization program currently handles temperatures in the range of 2&#8211;8 &#176;C. Based on current projections, Pfizer expects to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Also, another COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna has spurred a sell off in rival vaccine developers Pfizer, BioNTech, and AstraZeneca. Moderna&#8217;s vaccine candidate demonstrated an efficacy rate of 94.5% in a trial involving more than 30,000 infected patients. Its data revealed that side effects were generally short-lived and there were no significant safety concern, because no serious COVID-19 disease symptoms developed among trial participants. India&#8217;s SII also announced the completion of enrolment for phase 3 clinical trials. It was also observed that ICMR and SII have further collaborated for the clinical development of COVOVAX (Novavax) developed by Novavax, United States. Bharat Biotech is set to begin phase 3 trials of COVAXIN involving about 26,000 volunteers across India and this will be conducted in partnership with ICMR. It is the largest clinical trial conducted for a COVID-19 vaccine in India. These reports have installed a seed of faith that a promising vaccine will be available shortly and ease out the suffering that the world is facing today due to this deadly pandemic. However and whatever be the situation humanity has always prevailed under affliction and the way scientists all over the world have united to find a permanent treatment for COVID-19 sooner than later the cure will be assured until then personal implementation of the protective measure remains inevitable.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s22"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Writing-Original draft: PD.
