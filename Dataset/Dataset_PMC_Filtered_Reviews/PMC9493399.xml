We also assessed whether lower amounts of antigen per viral strain in AZB-adjuvanted vaccines affected antibody responses. A robust search strategy identified scientific publications reporting 30 clinical trials, comprising data on 11,736 participants and 86 trial arms, for inclusion in the analysis. Local reaction rates (R
<sub>lr</sub>) appeared to be lower in AZB-adjuvanted vaccine treatment arms versus comparator vaccine treatment arms. Post-vaccination geometric mean titres in those exposed to AZB-adjuvanted vaccine and comparator vaccine treatment arms were similar in both children and adults aged 18&#8211;60 years, implying an antigen-sparing effect by AZB. Meta&#8209;regression analysis based on a literature search of records or reports of clinical trials featuring AZB and the inactivated subunit of influenza published between 1998&#8211;2018 was conducted online in January 2019 and updated in August 2019. This search covered trials performed between 1993 and 2016 and suggested that AZB did not contribute to vaccine reactogenicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>influenza vaccine</kwd><kwd>vaccine adjuvant</kwd><kwd>azoximer bromide</kwd><kwd>vaccine safety</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>review</kwd><kwd>meta-analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>NPO Petrovax Pharm LLC</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This investigation was funded by NPO Petrovax Pharm Limited Liability Company, Moscow, Russia. </funding-statement><funding-statement><italic toggle="yes">The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 1</title><p>Abstract: Text in the abstract and results were updated to specify the dates of studies included for analysis.

</sup> Despite ongoing research, understanding of the precise pathogenesis of disease and appropriate specific treatments remain elusive, leaving vaccination as the most effective means of prevention. Current licenced influenza vaccines involve either inactivated, live-attenuated or recombinant formulations and contain either the whole virion, split virion or viral subunits as the antigen. In particular, inactivated subunit (SU) vaccines possess a favourable tolerability and safety profile and are relatively simple to produce. Influenza vaccines aim to induce antibodies against viral hemagglutinin (HA) proteins which undergo steady antigenic drift and therefore require regular vaccine reformulation.

</p><p>An adjuvanted, inactivated subunit influenza vaccine for subcutaneous and intramuscular injection (Grippol, NPO Petrovax Pharm, Moscow, Russia) has been used in the Russian Federation and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States for over two decades. The vaccine contains influenza virus HA and neuraminidase subunits
<sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> adjuvanted by 500 &#956;g azoximer bromide (AZB, Polyoxidonium), an immune-modulating polymer belonging to a class of synthetic heterochain polyamines. Azoximer bromide itself, has a long history of use throughout the Russian Federation and neighbouring countries, both within clinical research and as an additional treatment for a variety of infections. This is due to its beneficial effects on a host&#8217;s innate immune responses, including enhancement of phagocytosis; and its anti-toxic effects, such as the reduction of free radicals.
<sup>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> The exact mechanism(s) by which AZB achieves these effects are not fully understood, with an effect on

<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> There are three formulations of Grippol, or azoximer-adjuvanted subunit vaccine (AZB-SU): Two trivalent formulations contain HAs of two strains of influenza A (from A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes) and one of two B strains (from B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage). The third formulation contains HAs of all four strains (quadrivalent). All formulations of AZB-SU contain 5 &#956;g HA per strain, a third less than the standard amount of 15 &#956;g HA.

Only data on SAE widely recognised to be related to vaccination were extracted, such as allergic reactions, Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome and narcolepsy. The primary immunogenicity outcome was pre- and post-vaccination GMT.

</p><p>All participants assessed for efficacy had three or four anti-HA titre values (one titre for each vaccine strain; A-H3N2 and A-H1N1, and one or two B strains), therefore trial arms were subdivided into sub-arms, one sub-arm per vaccine strain.

A breakdown of study population characteristics by trial is presented in
<italic toggle="yes">Extended data</italic>, Figure C. Eleven of the trials were uncontrolled or placebo-controlled standalone trials, 12 were randomised bridging trials (between AZB-SU formulations), and seven were randomised non-inferiority trials conducted with non-adjuvanted comparator vaccines. Fourteen trials (46.7%) assessed both safety and immunogenicity, 15 (50.0%) assessed safety only, and one (3.3%) assessed immunogenicity only. A total of 7037 participants (60.0%) in 56 treatment arms received the AZB-SU vaccine and 1391 (11.9%) participants in 15 treatment arms received comparator vaccines, which were either whole virus (Immunopreparation

Participants in trivalent AZB-SU arms received 15 &#956;g HA per dose in most cases, except in dose-finding trials where some participants received lower (7.5 &#956;g HA) or higher (30 &#956;g HA) doses. The HA amount of the influenza B component was increased from 5 &#956;g to 11 &#956;g (21 &#956;g HA per dose) in two trials (T14 and T16, Supplemental Materials Figure D). Participants in quadrivalent AZB-SU arms all received 5 &#956;g HA per vaccine strain (20 &#956;g HA per dose). All comparator vaccines contained 15 &#956;g HA per vaccine strain; participants in comparator treatment arms received 45 &#956;g HA per dose as all comparator vaccines were trivalent. A total of 2242 participants (19.1%) in 10 trial arms received a placebo (saline) and 1066 participants (9.1%) received no intervention. No data were reported for two no-intervention treatment arms, which were therefore excluded from the analysis. Other placebo or no-intervention arms that contained eligible data were included in the safety analysis and excluded from the immunogenicity analysis.

This conclusion particularly holds in elderly and vulnerable populations, the main target groups for yearly influenza vaccinations. Similarly, we noted that the antigen-sparing approach of including AZB and reducing total antigen (5 &#956;g vs 15 &#956;g HA per strain), resulted in similar antibody responses to non-adjuvanted vaccines in non-elderly patients; however, more data is necessary to make this conclusion for older populations.</p><p>Review of the available safety data suggests that AZB-SU vaccines are associated with fewer local reactions compared with vaccines that contained higher amounts of HA antigen; the incidence of systemic reactions, however, appears to be similar for AS-SU and other vaccines. This finding is congruent with observations made in large clinical trials, which showed an overall higher average rate of local reactions with higher HA per dose but little or no difference in the rate of systemic reactions.

</sup> The similarity in the systemic reaction rates between AZB-SU, placebo and comparator vaccines, suggests that the reporting of such systemic reactions was most likely to have been attributable to the act of intramuscular injection, or reflects little more than the everyday incidence of trivial symptoms that people experience; indeed, treatment arms in two trials (Trial 02 and Trial 08) had elevated R
<sub>sr</sub> values even though participants received no treatment. A symptomatic complex of systemic reactions following vaccination during pregnancy has been described, which was most often associated with psychological state and anxiety of the development of AEs in response to vaccination.

However, meta-regression analysis of the available data detected no difference in reaction rates after adjustment for mean age and the amount of HA administered, and predicted that AZB was not associated with intrinsic reactogenicity.</p><p>No SAEs of an allergic or neurological nature were reported in any of the trials selected for review, covering a total population of 11,736 participants. While this suggests a low risk of SAEs, a formal conclusion cannot be drawn as it exceeds the power of clinical trials to detect very rare events. However, favourable safety data come from a previous mass vaccination trial with AZB-SU that reviewed vaccination in nearly 420,000 paediatric participants and reported no more than 33 allergic SAEs (incidence: 0.008%; one event per 12,700 participants vaccinated) and no SAEs that were neurological in nature.

</p><p>The immunogenicity data collected on more than 3000 participants across 15 studies generally supported the antigen-sparing effect of AZB, maintaining efficacy although the amount of HA in AZB-SU was only a third of the standard dose in comparable non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines. It was clear that AZB-SU vaccines induced antibody production in both children and adults up to 60 years at levels similar to those noted with comparator vaccines. This observation was seen for all comparisons except for one study in favour of AZB-SU (Trial 10; see
<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, middle panel) which remains unexplained but may result from a data artefact. The data from older adults (&gt;60 years) were less robust, based on only three sub-arms. Analysis on post-PR
<sub>ab</sub> showed that clinical protection was not compromised in the AZB-SU vaccinees. Seroprotection and seroconversion data in AZB-SU treatment arms revealed that AZB-SU would have met CPMP criteria for annual re-licensing of vaccines in the European Union in both adults aged 18&#8211;60 years and adults &gt;60 years.</p><p>A possible limitation of this study is its partial reliance on reports provided by the manufacturer. The sponsor&#8217;s clinical study reports had not undergone peer review, although the data from many of them were published in peer-reviewed journals. However, it is expected that these reports were prepared in line with good clinical practice, with a view to submission to regulatory agencies, and were therefore conducted robustly, countering the potential for any selection or interpretation bias. Review of the funnel plot data for reactogenicity variables showed no evidence of bias. In addition, during preparation of this article, two new studies assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent vaccine. Their findings are in line with those reported here, and they also provide supportive information on the practical use of quadrivalent AZB-SU vaccines.

</p><p>Another possible limitation is the effect of pre-immunity and immune system status of the participants on their immune response to the vaccine and adjuvant. Natural antigenic drift results in different strains of influenza virus being prevalent annually. This results in individuals exhibiting a variable pre-immune status and response to vaccination that is dependent on the influenza strains they have previously encountered. The impact of this on vaccine and adjuvant effectiveness in this study is unknown. A study investigating MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, found the effectiveness of adjuvant to diminish with the age of participants, with the greatest effect in children with minimal pre-immunity/prior exposure to flu.

</sup> Similarly, the potential presence or absence of chronic diseases on the health of participants and their response to the vaccine must also be considered.

</sup> The limited number of trials and vaccines investigated in this study was insufficient to form a conclusion regarding the role of either pre-immunity or health status on the participants&#8217; response to the vaccines or adjuvants used. However, both present an avenue for future investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, the favourable safety profile and immunogenicity of AZB-SU vaccines, along with the reduced amount of antigen per dose and sparing effect of AZB, make AZB-SU vaccines good candidates for use not only during a pandemic or limited national capacity of vaccine production, but in general for seasonal influenza vaccination. Future research will be directed towards evaluating whether AZB also shows an antigen-sparing effect in elderly patients undergoing vaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec12"><title>Data availability</title><sec id="sec13"><title>Underlying data</title><p>Zenodo: Grippol Supplementary Files,

</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Provide a detailed information on the azoximer bromide adjuvant (Polyoxidonium), specifically its pharmacological properties.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> Thank you for your comment. A lot of the pharmacological information about azoximer bromide, including mechanism(s) of action and target(s) are still under investigation. However, the authorship believes all the relevant information has been included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>

<italic toggle="yes">In the "Definitions and outcomes" and "Statistical analyses" subsections, authors indicate the treatment outcomes, but the vaccination outcomes are required. To be clarified.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> The vaccination outcomes are the treatment outcomes described. In this context &#8216;treatment outcome&#8217; was used in a statistical sense, as opposed to the strict medical definition of the term, as this includes both the placebo and no-intervention arms.</p><p>

</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> The period of meta-analysis has been clarified in both the abstract and the results section.</p><p>
<bold>5) Discussion</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Comment:</bold>
</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">It is necessary to discuss whether the presence of chronic diseases affected immunogenicity depending on the vaccine type used with different antigens and adjuvants content. Besides, it is necessary to discuss the immunogenicity issues</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response: </bold>
</p><p> This is another great, relevant point to raise and has also been added to the potential limitations of this study. The presence of chronic diseases and their impact on immunogenicity in the context of different antigens and adjuvants, are areas the authorship have involvement in, but again, the level of data available in this study was insufficient to investigate it here.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article><sub-article article-type="peer-review" id="report123089"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5256/f1000research.79798.r123089</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Petra</surname><given-names initials="M">Marek</given-names></name><xref rid="r123089a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid" authenticated="false">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2913-1736</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="r123089a1">

<bold>Abstract</bold>
</p><p> The main results were obtained by quantitative meta-analysis. It would be appropriate to state it also in the abstract.</p><p> 2)
<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p> It will be suitable to better describe azoximer bromide, i.e. if it is used in some medical products, if it is a pharmacopoeial substance, etc.</p><p> 3)
<bold>Materials and methods</bold>
</p><p> A meta-analysis was conducted, therefore the MOOSE assessment (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) is missing.</p><p> In addition, the authors omitted the bias risk assessment according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. It is not clear if the study outcome can be burdened by this risk of bias.</p><p> The fixed-effects method is applied in the case of studies' homogeneity.

<bold>1) Abstract</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Comment:</bold>
</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">The main results were obtained by quantitative meta-analysis. It would be appropriate to state it also in the abstract.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> The initial wording of the abstract was unintentionally misleading and placed undue emphasis on the term &#8216;meta-analysis&#8217;. The main results of this study were obtained through systematic review and consisted of various point estimates from single trials/trial arms. The pooled rate differences discussed, and incorporated in Figure&#160;3, are averages of the rate difference estimates from the involved trials, weighted by their inverse variance. This method was adopted over other techniques, such as unweighted average, and overall median, due to its superior accuracy. The results of this method are purely descriptive in nature, offering no particular conclusion beyond the expected result that the PO vaccine and comparators are similar in reactogenicity.</p><p> The wording has been altered to more accurately portray the importance of anything related to meta-analysis.</p><p>
<bold>2) Introduction</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Comment:</bold>

<italic toggle="yes">It will be suitable to better describe azoximer bromide, i.e. if it is used in some medical products, if it is a pharmacopoeial substance, etc.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold> Additional information has been added to the Introduction to briefly expand upon the usages of azoximer bromide.</p><p>
<bold>3) Materials and methods</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Comment 1
<italic toggle="yes">:</italic>
</bold>
<italic toggle="yes">A meta-analysis was conducted, therefore the MOOSE assessment (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) is missing.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold> As mentioned in the earlier response, the term &#8216;meta-analysis&#8217; was afforded undue importance. Originally the manuscript incorporated both a systemic review and meta-analysis, with the latter becoming less important and ultimately relegated into a hypothesis-creating tool as opposed to a central component of the study, as the significance of the data identified by the systematic review became more apparent.</p><p> As such, the full MOOSE assessment was determined to be extraneous to the study in the context of the data from which the manuscript&#8217;s conclusions are drawn.</p><p>
<bold>Comment 2:</bold>
<italic toggle="yes"> In addition, the authors omitted the bias risk assessment according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. It is not clear if the study outcome can be burdened by this risk of bias.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> As mentioned earlier, the importance of the meta-analysis in this manuscript was over-stated, with the results being generated by a systematic review. As such the bias risk assessment was not determined to be necessary for the finished manuscript.</p><p>
<bold>Comment 3:</bold>
<italic toggle="yes"> The fixed-effects method is applied in the case of studies' homogeneity. There is no explanation of the I-V method, i.e. the selection criteria. Furthermore, the random-effects method helps to evaluate the literary bias. Therefore, both results are required.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> The I-V method, and random effects methods were both part of the meta-analysis, which, as mentioned, was relegated to a hypothesis-creating tool only.</p><p>
<bold>4) Results</bold>

<bold>Comment:</bold>

<italic toggle="yes">Page 13, line 268: "The respective ratios included 1.0...", this should read: "The confidence interval of appropriate ratios included&#8230;".</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> Thank you for pointing out this oversight, a more accurate phrasing of the sentence that is closer to its original intent, has been drafted.</p><p>
<bold>5) Discussion</bold>

<italic toggle="yes">Influenza vaccine is a specific vaccine depending on seasonal influenza strains changing every year.</italic>
</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes"> Therefore, it should be discussed whether this specific feature of influenza seasons had an effect on the immunogenicity and, possibly, the safety of the adjuvanted influenza vaccine being evaluated.</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Response:</bold>
</p><p> This is an excellent point to raise and has been added to the potential limitations of this study. Members of the authorship have conducted some investigations into the impact of these features of influenza in the context of a different adjuvant, but the level of data available in this study was insufficient to investigate it here.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article></article></pmc-articleset>
