While most COVID-19 vaccines provide adequate protective immunological response against the original SARS-CoV-2 variant, there is a pressing need to understand their biological and clinical responses. Recent evidence suggests that some of the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 evade the protection conferred by the existing vaccines, which may impede the ongoing efforts to expedite the vaccination programs worldwide. These concerns have also highlighted the importance of a pan-COVID-19 vaccine, which is currently in the making. Thus, it is imperative to have a better molecular and clinical understanding of the various COVID-19 vaccines and their immunological trajectory against any emerging variant of concerns (VOCs) in particular to break this vicious cycle. Furthermore, other treatment regimens based on cellular therapies and monoclonal antibodies should be explored systematically as an alternative and readily available option considering the possibility of the emergence of more virulent SARS-CoV-2 mutants. In this review, we shed light on the various molecular mechanisms and clinical responses of COVID-19 vaccines. Importantly, we review the recent findings of their long-term immune protection and efficacy against emerging VOCs. Considering that other targeted and effective treatments will complement vaccine therapy, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of cell-based therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents as alternative and readily available treatment modalities against any emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd><kwd>variant of concern</kwd><kwd>therapeutics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new virus from a wild market in Wuhan City, China, and had spread rapidly to almost every part of the world (<xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Zheng 2020</xref>). Due to its highly contagious nature, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared as pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Cucinotta and Vanelli 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 causes a coronavirus disease called COVID-19 that has resulted in more than 4.87 million deaths worldwide as per the WHO report on October 15, 2021 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/" ext-link-type="uri">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). The COVID-19 outbreak and its widespread disruption in health and the economy have prompted scientists to look for different therapeutic strategies to minimize viral spread and the morbidities associated with it. Different therapeutic approaches such as convalescent therapy, monoclonal antibody treatment, immunotherapies, cell-based therapies, and vaccine therapeutics are available and used to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2020</xref>). Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent therapy has been used since the late 19th century against infectious diseases, recently reviewed by <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Katz (2021)</xref>. Convalescent plasma has also shown moderate success in a subset of COVID-19 patients, while in others this treatment offered very little respite (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Nagoba et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Owing to the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread, it was a challenging task to develop a new drug or a therapeutic agent at the earliest. In this challenging situation, some repurposed drugs and later immunotherapeutic options were introduced to limit hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The immunotherapeutic approaches were based on recombinant proteins or monoclonal antibodies generated against various antigens of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These antibody-based therapies became available as intravenous injection and, in some cases, as easy-to-use nasal sprays (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Kwon 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). However, the major breakthrough treatment came in the form of the much anticipated COVID-19 vaccines (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Kyriakidis et al., 2021</xref>). History tells us that developing a vaccine against a novel pathogen is a time-consuming process. However, the early development of the COVID-19 vaccines took the whole world by surprise, and the scientific community as well, as the general public had apprehensions about the safety, efficacy, and long-term health impact of these vaccines. About 126 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently in various stages of clinical development and around 194 in the preclinical stage according to the WHO report in August 2021 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines</ext-link>).</p><p>Now, as large populations worldwide are getting vaccinated, we have data regarding the safety, efficacy, and immunological response of these vaccines and other therapeutic interventions. Thus, in this review, we will discuss the molecular and clinical responses of various immunotherapeutic modalities, specifically the COVID-19 vaccine-based therapeutic interventions that are currently used to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and treat COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Immunomodulatory-Based Therapeutic Approaches for COVID-19</title><p>Considering the complexity of the immune response developed due to COVID-19, it is imperative to contemplate on the underlying immune response while designing the best possible therapeutic interventions (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>). As most of the complications seem to arise due to hyperactivated immune response-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), drugs modulating the pro-inflammatory responses may be effective (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Gibson and Qin, 2020</xref>). In this regard, immunotherapies and cell-based therapies are emerging as the promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of severe and critically ill patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">AminJafari and Ghasemi 2020</xref>). Immunotherapies targeting the cytokines implicated as the hallmark in cytokine storm and adoptive cell-based therapies such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), T cells, and natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies are in various phases of clinical testing for the treatment of COVID-19 (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Saeedi and Halabian, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Musial and Gorska-Ponikowska 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Convalescent Plasma Therapy</title><p>An immediate and readily available source to treat severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients is by taking advantage of traditional convalescent plasma therapy (CPT). The presence of virus-specific antibodies has been detected in most of the patients who have successfully eliminated the virus (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Casadevall and Pirofski 2020</xref>). The plasma containing antibodies from the recovered patients are thus given to the infected patients who could not mount an adequate humoral response (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Luke et al., 2006</xref>). This traditional approach is based on the principle that the neutralizing antibodies from the recovered patients will provide a similar and durable response in the infected patients who receive the CPT. Antibodies will either neutralize the virus or enhance their uptake by phagocytosis. Additionally, these antibodies will also activate other effector immune cells to eliminate the virus-infected cells by activating other immune functions such as NK cells. Considering the high success rate of CPT in previous SARS-CoV-1-infected patients (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al., 2005</xref>), it is plausible to use a similar approach for COVID-19. The ease of availability of plasma from a large number of infected COVID-19 donors seems a rational therapeutic option at hand before any other potential therapies become available for emerging variants of concern (VOCs), which escape the immunity conferred by the existing vaccines (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Lopez Bernal et al., 2021</xref>). Previous data from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals treated with CPT showed moderate success in a subset of patients. In a small cohort of 10 severe cases of COVID-19, Duan et al. showed that all patients successfully recovered after convalescent plasma transfusion (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, the study by Shen et al. demonstrated 100% recovery in five critically ill patients after they received the plasma transfusion (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, in a case study on a single critically ill patient who exhibited respiratory distress, CPT along with remdesivir showed a promising recovery rate (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>). Many other early clinical reports have shown promising results with CPT, reviewed by <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Casadevall et al. (2020)</xref>. Besides, more than 100 clinical trials are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov.in. These early clinical findings thus suggest that CPT is a potential therapeutic intervention for severe and critically ill patients and should be explored in cases of emergent new variants, where vaccines are not available or have failed to provide protection (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Kanj and Al-Omari 2021</xref>). However, caution should be exercised while using this approach as many studies have shown contradicting results (<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and He 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Tiberghien et al., 2020</xref>). Particularly, to ensure virus-free plasma, optimization of the dosage and time of delivery should be critically evaluated (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Targeted Immunotherapy Approaches for COVID-19</title><p>Consistently, the levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) are increased in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients, which is thus being considered as the prognostic and predictive disease biomarker along with the numbers of neutrophil/lymphocytes (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Santa Cruz, 2021</xref>). The presence of increased levels of IL-6 are detected in blood and in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), thus making this cytokine as a potential therapeutic target. Approaches to neutralize IL-6 usually rely on the use of anti-IL6R antibody to inhibit IL-6 signaling. Previous studies on cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during cancer immunotherapy have shown clinical success of the anti-IL6R-directed antibody tocilizumab (TCZ) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Khadka et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, TCZ is an approved drug for the treatment of other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (<xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Yazici et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it was rational to test this drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Several reports have suggested the beneficial effect of TCZ in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. The study by Luo et al. found that out of 15 patients, 11 responded well to the treatment and showed stable disease condition and a marked decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In a cohort of 100 critically ill patients, TCZ treatment was associated with a high recovery rate and a significant improvement in cytokine storm and clinical symptoms (<xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Toniati et al., 2020</xref>) Similarly, a 92% recovery rate was observed in patients who received TCZ treatment in comparison to the 42.1% recovery rate in patients who received a combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and ritonavir (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, in a very recent study by Xu et al., a 100% recovery rate was observed in 20 severe and critically ill patients who received TCZ treatment (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, others have also observed the beneficial effect of TCZ (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). On the contrary, TCZ was shown to exhibit no added benefit in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients who were compared with a combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and a prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Colaneri et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, the study carried out by Carlo Salvarani et al. compared TCZ treatment with standard care on the clinical worsening of COVID-19 patients. In this study, it was found that clinical worsening in COVID-19 patients was not effectively prevented by the administration of TCZ (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Salvarani et al., 2021</xref>). The probable reason for this discrepancy could be the dose, time, and the combinatorial effect of other drugs, which were given along with TCZ. Furthermore, the underlying health conditions and comorbidities may have an impact on the therapeutic outcome of this treatment, which needs further exploration. Overall, the results with TCZ have been mostly promising so far, but its use in combination with other antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs has shown better results (<xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Currently, there are more than 50 clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov evaluating the potential efficacy of TCZ to minimize the cytokine storm and associated immunopathology. These studies will provide a detailed account of the therapeutic efficacy of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19.</p><p>Approaches handling angiogenesis such as anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) antibody (bevacizumab) or complement activation inhibitors such as anti-C5a antibody (eculizumab and avdoralimab) are also being explored <bold>(</bold>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Billioti de Gage et al., 2021</xref>). Other immunotherapy approaches that were investigated include blocking the inhibitory T-cell receptors by anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) or anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) antibody (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Pardoll and Drew, 2012</xref>). These approaches have been successfully used in cancer immunotherapy and other viral infections (<xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Velu et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, immunotherapeutic approaches to handle cytokine storm are in various phases of clinical trials or already approved for emergency use, such as therapies based on anti-IL-6, anti-GM-CSF (granulocyte&#8211;macrophage colony-stimulating factor), anti-IL-1&#946;, anti-JAK (Janus kinase), anti-CCR5, anti-TIGIT [T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-base inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains], and anti-IFN-&#947; (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Buckley et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, exploring the use of these targeted therapies for emergency use seems a rational and feasible approach, considering that T-cell exhaustion is highly prevalent in COVID-19 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">De Biasi et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Therapy for COVID-19</title><p>Owing to their immunomodulatory activity, MSCs exhibit greater potential to modulate the immunological response. Over the years, MSCs have shown greater promise for the treatment of chronic lung disease such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Harrell et al., 2019</xref>). The therapeutic potential of these cells is largely exhibited by their paracrine secretion of a range of anti-inflammatory molecules. Our own work has also established the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in preclinical animal models of various lung diseases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>). MSCs have been used for the treatment of acute lung diseases such as ARDS, as reviewed by <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al. (2020</xref>). Also, early studies in ARDS models have also strengthened this notion that MSCs have an impressive potential to be used as a therapeutic approach to manage the consequences of a hyperactive immune system (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Mei et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have established the safety and efficacy of these cells in patients with ARDS (<xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Simonson, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Matthay et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, owing to their safety profile and immunomodulatory activity, MSCs can be tested as a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19 patients. Clinical studies have suggested the early efficacy of these cells in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Last year, a 65-year-old COVID-19 patient showed recovery from ICU in about a week after treatment with umbilical cord-derived MSCs. In another study of seven patients, MSCs resulted in the improvement of disease after just 2&#160;days of treatment. MSC treatment was associated with a significant decline in TNF-&#945; and CRP, with a concomitant increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Leng et al., 2020</xref>). Besides their direct immunomodulatory potential, MSC-derived products such as exosomes also hold great therapeutic promise. Sengupta et al. evaluated the effect of exosomes derived from allogeneic bone marrow MSCs. Interestingly, these immunomodulatory molecules showed 71% recovery rate in a cohort of 24 severe and critically ill patients (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Sengupta et al. 2020</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that MSCs may hold promise in alleviating the hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19 patients infected with new variants of SARS-CoV-2. Several ongoing clinical trials are currently underway to explore in a holistic manner the protective effects of MSCs against COVID-19 (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Leng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Moll et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Saleh et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Other Adoptive Cell Transfer-Based Therapies for COVID-19</title><p>Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) is emerging as the most promising approach for the treatment of cancer. The current approach uses chimeric antigen-expressing T cells called CAR-T cells for the treatment of hematological malignancies, reviewed by <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Landoni and Savoldo (2018)</xref>. The overwhelming success rate of this approach has encouraged researchers to use a similar approach for the treatment of COVID-19. However, limitations associated with this approach may hamper its use in COVID-19, specifically the associated high cost and CRS, which may additionally contribute to hyper-inflammatory response. Besides, CAR-T cell therapy has mostly remained confined to autologous approaches, while it is difficult to obtain the optimal functional T cells from severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients due to lymphopenia and lymphocyte exhaustion (<xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, an alternative approach based on NK cells is currently being investigated, as NK cell-based therapy is not associated with CRS and can be used as an allogeneic source owing to their low graft-<italic toggle="yes">versus</italic>-host disease (GvHD) (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). There are ongoing trials based on NK adoptive cell treatment (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04900454">NCT04900454</ext-link>). One such elegant approach using chimeric receptor-expressing NK cells is being evaluated. In this, off-the-shelf IL-15 superagonist and GM-CSF neutralizing single-chain variable fragment (scFv) NK cells are being evaluated (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Kundu et al., 2021</xref>). These dual cytokine-secreting cells will ensure the regulated activation of the adoptively transferred NK cells by the IL-15 superagonist and also handle the cytokine storm by neutralizing GM-CSF. Additionally, many more clinical trials are reported in ClinicalTrials.gov.in, which are evaluating the therapeutic potential of NK cells for COVID-19, the success of which will determine the application of this approach against any emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Monoclonal Antibody-Based Therapy</title><p>Monoclonal antibody-based therapy is currently considered the most successful treatment for COVID-19 besides the protection conferred by vaccines, reviewed by <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2021)</xref>. A large repertoire of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies has been developed using various approaches, such as humanized animals, chimeric animals, phage display assay, and direct use of B cells from COVID-19 patients. In the next section, we will briefly discuss about the recent developments in the clinical application of therapeutic antibodies for COVID-19 treatment.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nasal Delivery of Antibody to Combat SARS-CoV-2</title><p>The delivery of neutralizing antibodies (IgG1 and isotypes) is usually carried out intravenously; however, these circulating antibodies lack efficient access to mucosal compartments, as is evident from a research carried out by DeFrancesco et al., where they have observed less antibody titer in the lungs as compared to the serum (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">DeFrancesco 2021</xref>). Delivering antibodies through the nasal route is an alternative to this approach and has an advantage for a pathogen causing respiratory tract infection such as SARS-CoV-2 because antibodies, if nebulized, can have greater access to the target cells compared to the intravenously delivered antibodies. Antibodies such as IgG and IgA1 have been reported to be nebulized through nasal inhalation (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Vonarburg et al., 2019</xref>). The major challenge for antibody-based therapy is the resistance attained by newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to different neutralizing IgG1 antibodies (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Wibmer et al., 2021</xref>). To overcome such resistance encountered by IgG-based antibody therapeutics, an engineered IgM neutralizing antibody (IgM-14) was developed by <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Ku et al. (2021a</xref>). Compared to its parent counterpart (IgG-14), IgM-14 (engineered antibody) was observed to be &gt;230-fold potent in neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. The resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2 and the VOCs, including the UK (B.1.1.7), Brazilian (P.1), and South African (B.1.351) strains, were shown to be neutralized by IgM-14 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Ku et al., 2021b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Antibody Cocktail Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection</title><p>The emergence of resistant strains due to antibody treatment interventions against pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) became the basis to developing an antibody cocktail approach against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#245;es et al., 2020</xref>). The antibody cocktail approach was observed to be beneficial against the rapid emergence of resistant mutations due to the single use of neutralizing antibody (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Baum et al., 2020</xref>). Regeneron Pharmaceuticals developed an antibody cocktail with the trade name REGN-COV2 that contains a combination of two SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies: casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987). The antibody cocktail containing two neutralizing and non-competing human IgG1 antibodies target the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus preventing viral entry <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> ACE2 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Baum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Weinreich et al., 2021</xref>). A phase 1/3 clinical trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of REGN-COV2, which involved hospitalized and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. A total of 269 patients received REGN-COV2 and placebo, among which 90 patients were assigned to receive high-dose (8.0&#160;g) REGN-COV2, 92 patients received a low dose (2.4&#160;g), and 93 received placebo. Interim results showed low-grade and a few toxic effects of both low- and high-dose REGN-COV2. Adverse effects of special interest were reported in 2 out of 93 patients in the placebo group and 2 out of 176 patients in the REGN-COV2 group (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Weinreich et al., 2021</xref>). Exogenous antibody treatment was better suited to those patients whose immune system had not yet been activated. However, patients who were already found serum-positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were able to clear the virus efficiently. Based on these clinical findings, emergency use of this cocktail was granted in the 2021 for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Similar antibody cocktails are being explored in various preclinical or clinical trials, and their success will determine the availability of this therapeutic modality against any emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Vaccine Therapeutics</title><p>Vaccine is a substance, usually an inactivated pathogen or its component [protein or a messenger RNA (mRNA)], that, when introduced into the host, can elicit an immune response by imitating the pathogen&#8217;s infection process. This imitation of the infection lasts for a short duration until the body has developed long-term memory against the specific infection (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Pulendran and Ahmed 2011</xref>). The aim of the vaccination is to prepare the body so that, in future, if there is an infection of the specific pathogen against which the vaccine was administered, memory cells will recognize and destroy the pathogen by releasing neutralizing antibodies. Vaccination, as a deliberate attempt at pathogen exposure, began in the lab of Louis Pasteur <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> his discovery of attenuated vaccine. He administered an aged culture of <italic toggle="yes">Pasteurella multocida</italic> to chickens that did not develop any disease-like symptoms; to his surprise, he observed that, on treating the same chickens with fresh culture of <italic toggle="yes">P. multocida</italic>, none of the subjects developed the disease (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Pasteur, 1880</xref>). This observation led him to infer that aged culture had developed resistance against the pathogen in the chicken, which helped the subjects to fight against the infection of fresh bacterial culture. This observation led Pasteur to hypothesize that pathogens can be attenuated by any kind of environmental insults such as chemicals and high temperature, and the attenuated pathogen can bring immunity in healthy individuals against the disease-causing pathogen. Louis Pasteur confirmed his hypothesis further by working on rabies and anthrax (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Pasteur, 1881</xref>). Due to the increased understanding regarding vaccine development, new endeavors of vaccine were brought into use, among which &#8220;antitoxin therapy,&#8221; also known as &#8220;serum therapy,&#8221; was an important discovery in the later part of the 19th century. Antitoxin preparations were first applied on animals, and the immunization studies on animals paved the way to applying this preparation in humans, which was utilized in 1931 (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Moss 2020</xref>). The development of toxoid (inactivated toxin by formalin) took place in the early 1920s and is being used with certain minor modifications. Over the decades, knowledge regarding vaccine development has increased at an enormous pace, which paved the way to developing new vaccines within a short span of time and with better specificity and effectiveness against a particular pathogen.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Types of Vaccines</title><p>Vaccines and vaccine development strategies have evolved with time, from traditional to new-generation vaccines. Traditional vaccines include whole pathogen vaccines, which can either be live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines. Live-attenuated vaccines consist of the pathogen with a highly reduced virulence (e.g., yellow fever/smallpox). On the other hand, inactivated vaccines are the chemically or thermally inactivated pathogens (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Polack et al., 2020a</xref>). Developing live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines is an age-old and well-established strategy harboring rapid immunogenic property and providing immunological memory against specific pathogens. However, the drawback related to their use is the safety concern, which is due to live-attenuated vaccines having the potential to revert back to the virulent form and may infect immune-compromised subjects (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bazin 2003</xref>). Similarly, attenuated vaccines do not exhibit durable immunological memory and, hence, may not show long-term safety. Inactivation of a pathogen must neutralize the virulence without compromising its immunogenicity, as evident from previous research conducted to solve the mystery of why children in Washington, DC, developed disease after receiving the vaccine against RSV infection in the late 1960s. The research has highlighted the ineffective activation of immune response against the pathogen, as the RSV vaccine was not able to produce specific antibody response; rather, a hyper-immune response condition, also called enhanced respiratory disease (ERD), was elicited (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Polack 2007</xref>). Advanced knowledge at the molecular level has highlighted an opportunity to identify and suppress the virulent genes of the pathogen to combat the problem of reversion of pathogenic virulence; however, safety concerns and short-term immunological memory persisted. Another approach is the subunit vaccine that consists of a part of the pathogen projected as an antigen to elicit immune response in the host organism. Adenoviral vectors are also being used to deliver some specific viral genes that can produce viral antigenic peptides in the host cells to elicit immune response (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Kremer 2020b</xref>). Adenoviruses are non-fatal viruses that can infect humans and other organisms. Their exploitation as a vector for delivering viral antigens in host cells is a promising tool for the development of vaccines (<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Tatsis and Ertl 2004</xref>). Other vaccine types directly use the nucleic acids (mRNA and DNA) integrated with nano-technological approaches for delivery, as used by Moderna and Pfizer for COVID-19 vaccines, which will be discussed in the later section (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Polack et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Corbett et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>General Mechanism of Vaccine Immunity</title><p>The immune system reacts against challenges, whether it is from a pathogen or from an immunization, by activating its diverse components. Detection is carried out by the innate immune system by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Within an APC, the antigen is processed to generate small protein fragments (peptides) that form a complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This peptide&#8211;MHC complex is expressed on these cells, which further elicit an immune reaction by specifically engaging innate immune cells such as T or B cells. During immunization, either a whole pathogen or its component (protein) is introduced into the body in the form of a vaccine. This vaccine is detected as a non-self-entity by the APCs, which process it in the same way the pathogen is processed and subjected for antigen presentation to immune cells. Briefly, the peptide&#8211;MHC complex is expressed on the cell surface as an antigenic determinant (epitope), which activates T and B cells to neutralize the specific antigen. During this course, some T and B cells differentiate into memory cells and provide long-term memory against a particular pathogen (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Clem 2011</xref>). <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows a general scheme of a vaccine-mediated immune response after its delivery inside the human body.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Scheme of the different vaccine strategies: (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic>) Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines contain mRNA encoding a pathogenic protein that acts as an immunogen to elicit cellular and humoral immune responses.

(<italic toggle="yes">II</italic>) DNA vaccines encoding a specific sequence for a pathogenic gene are captured by APCs that express and present the antigen to immune cells to elicit immune response (process depicted by the <italic toggle="yes">yellow arrow</italic>).

(<italic toggle="yes">IV</italic>) Inactivated whole pathogen vaccines contain whole pathogens that have been subjected to heat or chemical inactivation when introduced into the body (depicted by <italic toggle="yes">red arrow</italic>) and stay avirulent, but pathogenic. This strategy is not able to bring an effective cellular immune response because of the inactivation of immunogenic proteins, thus needing an adjuvant (<italic toggle="yes">yellow dots</italic>) to bring about such a response in the cells.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fphar-12-778219-g001.jpg"/></fig><p>The protective immunity against any viral infection has been attributed to the function of antibodies, especially neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Corti and Lanzavecchia 2013</xref>). These antibodies block the entry of viruses into the host cell, thus preventing infection. It has been the prime goal of vaccination to elicit adequate neutralizing antibodies. Different vaccines elicit different levels of serum antibodies serving as surrogates of protective immunity. These antibodies are measured using ELISA, lateral flow assay, hemagglutination assays, and live/pseudoviral-based neutralization assays (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Amanat et al., 2020</xref>). The activation of immune cells against the vaccines depends upon the type of vaccine and its route of administration. Certain vaccines, like the cholera and typhoid fever vaccines that were designed to promote IgA response through oral administration, show lower efficacies. In contrast, parenterally administered vaccines elicit long-term immunity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Clemens et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The molecular players in vaccine-mediated immunity involve B cells, which are activated by the binding of antigenic determinants (from a pathogen or immunization) to B-cell receptors (BCRs) or by antigen-specific T helper cells. Pathogens like viruses have highly repetitive structures that can efficiently crosslink BCRs. However, soluble antigens lack such property and are usually ignored by B cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bachmann and Zinkernagel 1997</xref>). After the binding of antigen to the receptors, B cells interact with T helper cells and macrophages to differentiate in the clones of antibody-secreting cells, also called plasma cells and memory B cells. Plasma cells constitutively secrete antigen-specific antibodies, right after the pathogen attack. However, memory B cells are responsible for long-term antibody response (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Amanna and Slifka 2011</xref>). Viruses usually bind to cell receptors; thus, the neutralizing antibody is directed against the viral protein that binds to the host cell receptor, thereby limiting the viral entry into the cells (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Murin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Long-term T-cell memory is a collaborative response of all T-cell populations against any cognate pathogen. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells represent the specific cellular arm of adaptive immune response against viral infection or immunization. A subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, also called T helper cells, recognizes processed antigens presented by APCs, especially dendritic cells (DCs). This process mounts a better immune response and memory compared to the immune response elicited by direct antigen binding by B cells (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Detection of vaccine-associated signals by DCs conditions them to express molecules like interleukin 12 (IL-12), which further help T cells to proliferate and differentiate into various phenotypes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Alcaide et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>COVID-19 Vaccines</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has put pharmaceutical companies and laboratories in a race to develop an effective and rapid COVID-19 vaccine. Both traditional as well as modern vaccine development strategies have been employed to develop an effective and safe vaccine for COVID-19. This becomes imperative when there is no suitable drug available in the market, owing to the novelty of the pathogen causing COVID-19. As of October 2021, around 194 vaccine candidates have been in the preclinical phase and 126 vaccine candidates in the advanced clinical phases (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines</ext-link>). Due to the availability of prior knowledge regarding the pathogenesis and immune responses of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS CoV), the vaccine development against SARS CoV-2 started at a remarkable pace (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Folegatti et al., 2020a</xref>). Early pieces of evidence have suggested that neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein might be an important hallmark for immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Wajnberg et al., 2020</xref>). These reports thus formed the basis for developing the COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have successfully passed clinical trials and are currently available in the market, as reviewed recently (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Kyriakidis et al., 2021</xref>). Most COVID-19 vaccines that obtained an emergency approval for their therapeutic use have been recommended for the population beyond the age of 18&#160;years, and in most countries, these vaccines are yet to be tested in children below 18&#160;years. Certain vaccines that are in the early stage of drug trials are reported to be intranasally administered, including ChAdOx1-S, AdCOVID, BBV154, and COVI-VAC, which may become the leading vaccines to be used for those below 18&#160;years old (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Lund and Randall 2021</xref>). Such vaccines have been used in the past to treat respiratory pathogens in children (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Mohn et al., 2018</xref>). There are challenges that can be encountered in the future regarding the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, as the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is rapidly evolving owing to its RNA genome (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2020</xref>).

In the phase 2/3 trial, 43,448 participants received injection, among which 21,728 were administered placebo and 21,720 participants received BNT162b2 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04368728">NCT04368728</ext-link>). During the follow-up, around 27% of BNT162b2 recipients and 12% of placebo recipients reported adverse but manageable side effects. Lymphadenopathy was reported in 0.3% of vaccine recipients and &lt;0.1% placebo recipients. In terms of efficacy, it was observed that BNT162b2 had an impressive 95.0% efficacy in the early trial results (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Polack et al., 2020a</xref>). However, the major limitation of this vaccine is the need for storage at lower temperatures ranging from &#8722;80&#176;C to &#8722;60&#176;C, which is challenging for most of the developing countries. Drug trial 2/3, which was carried out to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 30&#160;&#956;g BNT162b2 (given 21&#160;days apart) among participants 16&#160;years of age or older, found the vaccine to be safe with an efficacy of 95% (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Polack et al., 2020b</xref>).

No participant developed any serious complication immediately after the first vaccination. In the second vaccination process, no participant reported any adverse effect in the 25-&#956;g group; however, 40% of the participants in the 100-&#956;g group and 57% of the participants given 250&#160;&#956;g reported minor complications such as fever, mild fatigue, chills, and pain at the injection site.

Inactivation was carried out by treating the viral supernatant with &#946;-propiolactone. This vaccine can be stored and transported at refrigeration temperatures (2&#8211;8&#176;C). An early trial report conducted at Shangqiu City Liangyuan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Henan Province, China, has suggested that BBIP-CorV is an effective vaccine in all the age groups enrolled in the study. Vaccine/placebo recipients were separated randomly into two age groups: 18&#8211;59 and 60&#160;years. The vaccine was administered at a two-dose schedule (2, 4, or 8&#160;&#956;g) with a gap of 4&#160;weeks. The same immunogenicity profile was observed for the vaccine in both age groups. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer was higher at day&#160;42 in the age group 18&#8211;59&#160;years.

The primary immunogenicity profile of the 5- and 25-&#956;g doses of the vaccine plus adjuvant showed acceptable neutralizing antibody response correlating with anti-spike IgG (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Keech et al., 2020</xref>). Both vaccine and adjuvant can be stored at 2&#8211;8&#176;C.</p><p>Furthermore, in a phase 3 trial, 14,039 participants (7,020 in the vaccine group and 7,019 in the placebo group) were enrolled as per protocol and included for population efficacy (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04583995">NCT04583995</ext-link>). A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was given 21&#160;days apart, and an efficacy of 89.7% was observed (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Heath et al., 2021a</xref>). There were no hospitalizations or deaths among the 10 cases in the vaccine group: however, five cases of severe infection were reported among 96 in the placebo group. It was also worth observing that this vaccine was effective against variant B.1.1.7 and the non-B.1.1.7 variants, and the efficacy rates were observed to be 86.3% and 96.4%, respectively, using a <italic toggle="yes">post-hoc</italic> analysis (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Heath et al., 2021a</xref>). Shinde et al. carried out a study on the efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 against the B.1.351 variant of SARS-CoV-2. This was a phase 2-a trial that started in South Africa, where 6,324 participants received a single dose of vaccine/placebo. The recruited participants were either HIV-negative or medically stable HIV-positive. The vaccine was found to be efficacious in preventing COVID-19, with a higher efficacy rate among HIV-negative participants (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04533399" ext-link-type="uri">NCT04533399</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Shinde et al., 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s5-4-1"><title>Advantages and Limitations</title><p>As the vaccine is devoid of any infectious particle, it is thus safe for use. The benefit of using an adjuvant was clear in terms of the high magnitude of antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses compared to the antigenicity profile of the vaccine without adjuvant. This vaccine can be stored at 2&#8211;8&#176;C, thus mitigating cold chain storage and transport demands. The vaccines contain purified antigenic peptides to elicit immune response, thus avoiding the use of live components of the pathogen.</p><p>The limitation, as with all other vaccines, is that it needs booster doses to provide long-term immune response against the pathogen. The immune response remains low without the adjuvant; thus, the need of an adjuvant increases the cost of vaccine formulation. Since the isolated peptide is used to design the vaccine, the other limitations related to this technique is that the isolated protein, if denatured, may bind to nonspecific antibodies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Future Perspectives</title><p>After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an immediate need for treatment arose to limit the spread of the disease. Initially, repurposed antiviral drugs and other anti-inflammatory treatment regimens were tested. Antiviral drugs such as remdesivir had a significant effect of minimizing the hospitalization in a subset of patients, but this drug also fell short of expectations (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Hoek and Sarahanne, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Masoomikarimi et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, CPT showed promising results in earlier clinical trials, but this therapy was also limited due to technical difficulties and safety concerns. However, antibody-based therapies presented a promising approach in dealing with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and many therapeutic antibodies were approved for the treatment of patients with mild and moderate symptoms (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). Besides the existing approaches for developing therapeutic antibodies, several engineered antibody-based therapies, including antibody cocktails and nasal sprays, showed promising clinical outcomes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Baum et al., 2020</xref>). These short-term protective therapeutic modalities may also work against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, but a long-term and sustainable treatment is what would change the COVID-19 infection landscape. In this direction, vaccines will remain the mainstay therapeutic modalities for COVID-19, which has already documented successful and lasting protective immunity. Modern vaccines such as those based on mRNAs designate a new era in vaccinology as the approach is being used against infectious diseases, and they appear ideal for use against any emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and non-pathogenic diseases such as cancer (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Pardi et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the pan-COVID-19 vaccine (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Saunders et al., 2021</xref>), which is in the making, holds an enormous promise to target multiple and any new variants of coronaviruses&#8212;a hope for the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The support of Ramalingaswami Fellowship Grant (BT/RLF/Re-entry/09/2015) from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Early Career Research Award Grant (file no.
