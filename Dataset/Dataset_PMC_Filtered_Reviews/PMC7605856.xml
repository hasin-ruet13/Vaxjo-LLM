As science reveals an enhanced understanding of biological processes, new therapeutic modalities are becoming important in developing breakthrough therapies to treat both rare and common diseases. As these new modalities progress, concern and uncertainty arise regarding their safe handling by the researchers developing them, employees manufacturing them and nurses administering them. This manuscript reviews the available literature for emerging modalities (including oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins and bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, peptides, vaccines, genetically modified organisms, and several others) and provides considerations for occupational health and safety-oriented hazard identification and risk assessments to enable timely, consistent and well-informed hazard identification, hazard communication and risk-management decisions. This manuscript also points out instances where historical exposure control banding systems may not be applicable (e.g. oncolytic viruses, biologics) and where other occupational exposure limit systems are more applicable (e.g. Biosafety Levels, Biologic Control Categories).</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1"

As the scientific field advances through an enhanced understanding of biological processes, the role of genetics and the interplay among peptides/DNA/RNA, and how these interactions relate to both the cause and cure of disease, many new therapeutic modalities are becoming important in developing breakthrough therapies to treat both rare and common diseases. In addition to novel modalities, increasingly potent and persistent medicines are being designed to enable lower doses and less frequent dosing. As compounds become more potent, even seemingly small amounts of dermal or inhalation exposure can pose significant health hazards to the employee who is synthesizing and manufacturing the drug, to the health care worker who is administering the drug, to the patient performing self-administration (e.g. subcutaneous injection of protein therapeutics at home) and/or to others in the shared facilities, clinics, or homes where these activities are taking place. There have been several attempts to identify and communicate the hazards associated with drugs via the safety data sheet (SDS), Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) categorizations, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) hazardous drug list (<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Nations U, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2016</xref>). However, guidance is also needed for those preparing the SDSs and assigning hazard classifications.</p><p id="p0625">As the bulk of novel modality pharmaceuticals being evaluated/developed are in the discovery phase of drug development, they tend to lack appreciable nonclinical and clinical data, including pharmacological potency and toxicity information. Compounds with limited data, such as those in early discovery research and development, are placed into occupational exposure control bands (ECBs; also commonly referred to as occupational exposure bands [OEBs] or occupational health categories [OHCs]). Occupational banding/categorization systems essentially pair a hazard determination with an acceptable occupational exposure concentration range along with appropriate exposure controls and handling practices. These bands are assigned based on historical experience and information, read-across strategies, <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> evaluations, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> screening data, and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> data (where available) conducted to elucidate a compound's pharmacological and/or toxicological characteristics and subsequent hazard assumptions and classifications.</p><p id="p0630">What follows is an overview of occupational hazards and risks associated with several of the most broadly utilized pharmaceutical modalities.

The original occupational health categorization practices were developed in the pharmaceutical industry and such hazard classification and category-based systems are deeply embedded in occupational health and safety practices, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry (<xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Naumann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib158" ref-type="bibr">Zalk and Nelson, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2019</xref>). Additionally, such systems are elements of well-developed, current hazard communication programs (e.g., United Nations 2019 Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals) (<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Nations U, 2019</xref>). Occupational health categorization and compound handling practice systems are considered standard practice throughout the pharmaceutical industry in both research and manufacturing operations.</p><p id="p0680">The occupational categorization system was designed to give guidance, based on historical experience, on safe handling practices for compounds with limited data as a stopgap until additional relevant data could be generated. For pharmaceuticals with robust data sets, compound-specific occupational exposure limits (OELs) are established to protect employees. However, when there is limited data for a compound, occupational exposure banding is often employed to establish occupational exposure constraints. While an OEL is a specific airborne concentration limit usually presented in units of &#956;g/m<sup>3</sup> or parts per million (ppm), an occupational ECB is a range of airborne concentrations to which exposure to a compound should be controlled to ensure worker safety (See <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>

The basic premise of the ECB classification system is to place chemicals into categories based on their inherent toxicity and potency, which offers a simplified solution for controlling worker exposures to compounds in the workplace. Briefly, an initial hazard assessment is conducted in an effort to identify potential exposure ranges expected to represent negligible risk for the physical (e.g. corrosivity), toxicological, and/or pharmacological effect(s) of concern. The mechanism of pharmacological action, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro/in vivo</italic> potency, preclinical dose-response related effects, bioavailability (inhalation, oral and dermal), therapeutic dose, and the spectrum and severity of clinically observed adverse effects of a specific drug substance, all provide the basis for the hazard assessment. Preclinical data such as QSAR (<italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> predictive systems) and animal data is also considered in the hazard assessment, and one or more compound characteristic may be responsible for placing a compound in a specific ECB. It is generally prudent to assign compounds to more protective bands earlier in their development, and as new data emerges, subsequently adjust their occupational exposure limits/bands to less restrictive bands and corresponding handling practices (with the goal being to ensure workers in the early development space are adequately protected).</p><p id="p0690">The banding system is integrated into the organization's engineering controls and thus may be different across organizations. For illustrative purposes, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents a typical pharmaceutical compound banding system and is the one employed by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). The cutoffs for the bands/categories presented are based on several factors, including approaches based on the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) (<xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">NIOSH, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Dolan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Kroes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al., 1978</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Gould et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Guideline, 2018</xref>). While the TTC may not be originally derived for occupational purposes, the principles have been applied successfully in the field of occupational health and safety for the establishment of safe occupational exposure limits (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Chebekoue and Krishnan, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Carthew et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Hoersch et al., 2018</xref>). TTC limits can be applied using an assumed breathing volume of 10&#160;m<sup>3</sup> and 100% inhalation bioavailability.

Based on this information as well as extensive industrial hygiene monitoring conducted by BMS showing that airborne concentrations of biologics are most often &lt;1&#160;&#956;g/m<sup>3</sup> (data not shown), a simplified two-band system was developed for biologics for use when there is insufficient information available to calculate an OEL.

Note that while <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> illustrates the banding system that BMS implements for biologics, alternative schemes are also utilized in the pharmaceutical industry which are equally effective in controlling exposures. Additionally, for compounds expected to pose special hazards, a compound-specific risk assessment can be completed to confirm whether additional exposure controls are needed (e.g. BCC B controls with additional personal protective equipment). Also, note that once a sufficient data package is available to establish an OEL (also referred to as a health-based exposure limit [HBEL] or an exposure guideline [EG]), the BCC is of limited applicability.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Example of a biologic-specific banding system.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0030">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Biologic Control Category (BCC)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Range (&#956;g/m<sup>3</sup>)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Relevant Compounds</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">A</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&#8805;1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Biologics with low to moderate toxicity/potency</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Mid- to high- MW biological compounds, therapeutic proteins, PEGylated proteins, antibodies, adnectins</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">B</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&lt;1</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Especially toxic/potent biologics</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Potent proteins, bispecific antibodies or other large molecule biologics as determined by a case-by-case assessment</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Occupational Exposure Control Banding Decision Tree for Therapeutic Modalities.

One example of a prodrug is Vyvanse&#174; (a form of amphetamine used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) which is designed to have less abuse potential than other amphetamines due to the slower release of the active drug following bioconversion in the intestine/liver. Another example of a prodrug is omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor used to treat acid reflux and ulcers) which is bioactivated site-selectively in the acidic conditions of the stomach.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.1.4"><label>3.1.4</label><title>ADME</title><p id="p0725">The absorption of a small molecule drug is highly variable and dependent on multiple factors including its hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, size, molecular charge/ionization state, and plasma/protein binding potential. Small molecule drugs are generally administered orally and are designed to have high oral BA, which can give them an ease of use advantage over high MW drugs that require parenteral administration. Small molecule pharmaceuticals are designed to be stable alone and/or in formulation enabling a long shelf-life and the ability to reach cellular targets intact with consistent pharmacological potency (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). In most cases, prodrugs are simple chemical derivatives that are only one or two chemical or enzymatic steps away from the active parent drug.

The liver is generally assumed to be the major site of first-pass metabolism of a small molecule drug administered orally.</p><p id="p0730">There are many different routes of excretion including via the urine, bile, sweat, saliva, tears, milk, and stool. The majority of drugs are eliminated via pathways that involve the kidneys and/or the liver. A major characteristic of compounds excreted in urine is that they are polarized (i.e., charged) and water-soluble. Drugs that are lipid soluble are not readily removed by the kidneys and require hepatic metabolism (e.g. phase I and phase II biotransformation reactions) to increase their water solubility for possible urinary excretion (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Kapusta et al., 2007</xref>).

In the absence of inhalation BA data, it is acceptable to conservatively assume 100% of the inhaled dose reaches the systemic circulation.

Since the data to support the calculation of the OEL is not available in the early development space, assumptions need to be made to enable the determination of the appropriate ECB. These assumptions include information and confidence in the dose where biologically significant (and clinically relevant) pharmacology is expected. Adhering to the suggested doses where biologically significant pharmacology is observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> provides a 100-fold safety factor from the midpoint of the band for a 50&#160;kg individual (bodyweight recommended when establishing permissible daily exposure limits) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Agency, 2014</xref>). It is important to note that cytotoxic compounds, mutagens, teratogens and hormones may require a greater safety factor due to their potential for severely toxic effects. It is BMS's practice that the default band for pharmacologically-active, small molecule APIs can be considered to be ECB 4, however this default band should be reconsidered if a molecule is expected to be extremely potent/toxic or based on professional judgment.</p><p id="p0755">Another helpful piece of information when establishing the ECB is the projected (or actual) lowest human therapeutic dose. Compounds which may have a therapeutic dose of &lt;1&#160;mg/day may need to be placed into ECB 5 or 5 special case in order to allow for an acceptable margin of safety, in this instance defined as the exposure margin between the therapeutic dose and the midpoint of the occupational exposure band. Information on the PK of the compound such as half-life and oral BA, along with pharmacodynamics (PD), should also be considered if available. For example, a compound with a long half-life (on the order of days) may bioaccumulate, resulting in a lower acceptable occupational exposure than for a compound with a half-life of hours.

ONs are usually made up of 13&#8211;25 nucleotides and are designed to hybridize specifically to DNA or RNA sequences. ONs include antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), DNA duplexes, Aptamers, Spiegelmers, and RNA interference compounds (RNAi) such as small interfering RNA (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). ONs can be &#8216;locked&#8217; (LNA) or &#8216;unlocked&#8217; (UNA &#8211; unlocked nucleic acid) with LNAs generally having higher stability resulting in a longer half-life and stronger base-pairing potential than their unlocked counterparts. A typical ON is a short chain DNA or RNA molecule, with a MW&#160;&gt;&#160;7000&#160;Da, manufactured by an isolated/enclosed process such as solid phase synthesis followed by preparative chromatographic purification and downstream processing.

ON drugs target mRNA and are generally synthesized to match a specific nucleotide sequence of interest. Pharmacology is dependent on Watson-Crick base pairing between the drug and an mRNA target molecule, a scenario that provides for both high affinity and exquisite specificity. ONs such as RNAi compounds are important tools for therapeutic use because of the roles they play in controlling gene expression. ONs can alter gene expression through a variety of mechanisms by targeting mRNA for degradation by cellular RNase H activation or blocking ribosome initiation of protein translation (<xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">Templin et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2.3"><label>3.2.3</label><title>Marketed drugs</title><p id="p0775">Though there are many clinical trials ongoing (&gt;100 ONs are in clinical trials), there are only a few ON-based drugs approved to date, which include Vitravene&#174; (no longer marketed) and Macugen&#174; (<xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">Stein and Castanotto, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2.4"><label>3.2.4</label><title>ADME</title><p id="p0780">Once in the systemic circulation, ONs are generally taken up endocytically and distributed to the lysosomes or target mRNA.

Effects on tissues are generally related to deposition and accumulation. The most common effect in the clinic is transient, blood-level-dependent effects stemming from interaction with plasma proteins. Theoretical causes for concern with ONs documented in the literature include the potential incorporation of degradation products of phosphorothioate nucleotides into newly synthesized DNA, as well as the binding of ONs to DNA resulting in triplex formation that could ultimately induce site-specific mutations (<xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Vasquez et al., 2000</xref>).

Due to the high binding specificity and affinity of the mAb for its target, target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) is a major route of elimination for many mAbs with a membrane-standing target, especially at low doses and concentrations. TMDD consists of receptor-mediated endocytotic internalization of the IgG molecule and subsequent lysosomal degradation. The rate of elimination of a protein therapeutic is dependent on the expression of the target receptor, the affinity of the mAb for the receptor, the dose of the mAb, the rate of receptor therapeutic protein internalization, and the rate of catabolism within the target cell. It is important to note that the antibodies cleared primarily by TMDD will have dose-dependent nonlinear elimination. Additionally, the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) can neutralize mAbs and cause them to be cleared faster (<xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">Vande Casteele and Gils, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0960">The clearance of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) typically does not involve cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated metabolism or interaction with cell membrane transporters (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ferri et al., 2016</xref>).

The mechanistic basis for the ADC activity includes its specific binding to the cellular target, triggering ADC cellular internalization by pinocytosis, followed by the intracellular release of the payload (<xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, after administration into the systemic circulation, the antibody fragment guides the complex to the targeted tumor antigen where it becomes internalized into the cancer cell (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et al., 2018</xref>). The intracellular release of the payload in its active form results in cell death. The three components of ADCs, namely the antibody, the linker and the cytotoxic drug, have their own inherent characteristics and limitations which influence each other, thus finding the best combination of these components to design an ideal ADC is a complicated task (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et al., 2018</xref>). Although this targeted approach appears straightforward, its translation to clinical practice has been problematic with initial attempts failing due to inappropriate linker systems or insufficiently potent cytotoxins, resulting in unfavorable therapeutic indices.

After systemic administration, the distribution of the intact ADC is generally confined to the plasma, interstitial fluid, and lymph (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Han and Zhao, 2014</xref>).

Linking strategies that take advantage of the properties of endogenous amino acids (such as engineered antibodies or peptides) are unlikely to be toxic on their own, or to significantly contribute to the toxicity of either the antibody or the payload.

Potential issues include the possibility of linking to endogenous proteins or other cellular macromolecules, or altered immune responses.</p><p id="p1055">For the ADC as a whole, it is important to note that even though the payload is connected to an antibody, it does not mean that the toxicity to the payload will be reduced. There is a strong possibility that the payload could be released despite not having a (tumor) binding site. Therefore, it is critical to account for the hazards associated with the payload and not to assume the linker to the antibody is systemically stable.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5.6"><label>3.5.6</label><title>Occupational hazard and exposure considerations</title><p id="p1060">In the workplace, potential routes of exposure to the intact ADC or its respective components include inhalation, ingestion (via mucocilliary transport from the lung, hand to mouth contact, etc.) and dermal contact (depending on MW, etc.). The overlying concern with occupational exposure to these types of molecules is the highly potent and toxic nature of the payload component. A critical attribute of any ADC is the amount of drug loading, or the average ratio of conjugated payload to antibody. This is referred to as the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). Since the DAR dictates the amount of payload delivered per internalized antibody, it strongly influences both efficacy and toxicity. In addition, depending on the conjugation and linker technologies used, high-DAR ADCs can have poor biophysical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity, aggregation) that reduce efficacy and increase toxicity (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Drake and Rabuka, 2017</xref>). Another important factor to consider when assessing the toxicity of the ADC and individual components is the relative size of the component molecules. While the payload and linker may have molar masses in the several hundreds of Da, the antibody will typically have a molar mass of around 150,000&#160;Da, though antibody fragments may be significantly smaller. As such, the payload element of the ADC may only constitute less than 0.5% by weight of the total MW; a potentially important fact when safe exposure levels are typically quoted in mass terms. Of course, with smaller antibody fragment utilization, this effect will be reduced and the toxic payload will constitute a greater proportion of the compound mass.</p><p id="p1065">During each step to the manufacturing process, the hazards may change based on the nature of the components being utilized in that step of the manufacturing process. The relatively low toxicity of antibody proteins, and the common processing of such macromolecular materials in enclosed solution or suspension forms, results in a relatively low risk of intolerable exposure by main traditional routes (inhalation, ingestion and skin absorption). In addition, the BA of such large biologically derived macromolecules by traditional exposure routes (ingestion and airborne inhalation) is low due to instability of proteins in the GI tract as well as low inhalation BA of such large molecules from the respiratory tract. The processes used for the manufacture of payload and subsequent conjugation to the antibody scaffold are typical &#8220;wet chemistry&#8221; covering all normal synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical processing steps for small molecules, which includes the synthesis of the payload and linker and associated purification and isolation steps including chemical reaction, chromatography distillation, filtration, crystallization, drying and lyophilization, with solvent recovery and emission control. Given the known toxicities of payload materials, activities such as payload manufacture and handling of pure payload material prior to conjugation, and especially any processes involving open handling of such materials, especially in a dry powder form, are considered a high risk of unacceptable exposure. Similarly, ancillary activities such as Quality Control (QC) testing and cleaning, where exposure to the payload as either a trace residue or component of a sample may occur, should also be considered.</p><p id="p1070">Major concerns during synthesis and conjugation will include all activities where manual intervention is required, transfer of materials between processes except in sealed transit routes, and in recovery and storage of the high toxicity material in a form which may present enhanced emission risks by certain routes; for example as a dry friable solid for airborne transfer, or as a solution in an organic solvent for transdermal transfer. The high toxicity of the payload and of the ADC requires a more rigorous consideration of the routes of exposure than might be typical for small molecule applications where typically only airborne and (occasionally) surface transfer routes are considered. It is important to note that a payload could be released from an ADC despite not having a binding site. Therefore, it is critical to protect directly for the contribution of the payload and not to assume the linker to the antibody is systemically stable. The extreme toxicity of the payload warrants consideration of all routes, with control of hand contamination in particular being a concern as this is a major transfer route into ocular and ingestion routes of exposure. The high toxicity and uncertainty of exposure uptake efficiencies means that other activities that may lead to exposure to trace levels of residues, such as might occur during manual cleaning of contaminated equipment, may be significant, and the potential and mechanisms for equipment and containers to become contaminated on exposed external surfaces should also be assessed.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5.7"><label>3.5.7</label><title>Occupational exposure banding guidance recommendation</title><p id="p1075">Occupational exposure banding recommendations are based on the inherent hazards associated with exposures to each component of the ADC manufacturing process.

The general viral cycle involves adenoviral recognition of its specific receptor on the cell surface thus triggering its internalization. Following this internalization, the adenovirus migrates through the microtubules and subsequently introduces the viral genome inside the nucleus. The adenovirus genome is composed of linear, double-stranded DNA of approximately 36 kilobases, which can be divided into early (E) and late (L) genes based upon their expression across the infection cycle (<xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">Seth and Higginbotham, 2000</xref>). While the L genes encode structural proteins, which package the viral DNA into the adenovirus virion during the final stages of replication, the E genes regulate viral replication itself, including entry of the virus into the host cell and entry of the virus genome into the nucleus. The proteins encoded by E1A specifically, are produced immediately after infection to modulate the cell cycle, recruit cellular proteins, and regulate the expression of cellular and viral genes (<xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">Wechman et al., 2016</xref>). The E1A protein binds the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) resulting in the release of E2F (E2 factor) and cell cycle arrest.

The use of this technology for vaccines is in the spotlight since, in addition to the ease of oral administration, GM bacteria are relatively inexpensive to propagate/manufacture and transport (resistant to poor refrigeration), and thus the ongoing revolution in GM bacteria for vaccination fits well with the World Health Organization (WHO) agenda and recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.9.2"><label>3.9.2</label><title>How they work</title><p id="p1230">GM bacteria serve as drug delivery systems, which, upon oral administration, can carry the drug and deliver it to a local environment such as the gut or mucosa, without the need for systemic exposure. GM bacteria are being regarded as a technologically viable, economically-feasible, safe delivery modality for drugs/proteins to localized areas in the body (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>). The insertion of plasmid vectors, which encode proteins such as enzymes, antibodies, antigens and cytokines into living bacteria, enables these GM bacteria to produce or deliver the therapeutic proteins/molecules to the target site. GM bacteria have also been designed to convert pro-drugs to their active form at the localized disease site (<xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Pinero-Lambea et al., 2015</xref>). GM bacteria can bypass problems associated with conventional cancer chemotherapies, such as poor selectivity and limited tumor penetrability, and can be finely engineered to sense and respond to the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Forbes, 2010</xref>). Local delivery of recombinant proteins via GM bacteria in affected organs also has many advantages as systemic side effects are generally avoided.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.9.3"><label>3.9.3</label><title>Marketed drugs</title><p id="p1235">Currently, there are no approved GM bacterial therapeutics.

The introduction of human vaccines has had a tremendous impact on global health by dramatically reducing the mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. Vaccination is considered one of the most cost effective and successful medical interventions ever introduced. Vaccines have inevitably prevented diseases, complications, and the death of millions of people by protecting against many deadly and debilitating infectious diseases including smallpox and polio (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Kallerup and Foged, 2015</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends routine immunization against 22 different diseases (<xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.10.2"><label>3.10.2</label><title>How they work</title><p id="p1265">The ideal vaccine elicits the exact immune response that occurs during natural infection, safely inducing a strong humoral and cellular immune response. Vaccines work by mimicking disease agents and stimulating the immune system to build up defenses against them. Vaccines are generally created to express one or more antigens present on a pathogen to prime an individual's immune system, so that if the individual is exposed to the pathogen in the future, the immune system will respond swiftly with a specific defense. Briefly, antigen-presenting cells (APCs; e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages) take up and process the pathogen-specific antigen(s) and present them to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via the MHC class II pathway and then to B cells, ultimately resulting in the production of antibodies. For most infectious diseases, primary protection is mediated by existing antibodies, whereas for intracellular pathogens (e.g. mycobacterium tuberculosis), protection is mediated by MHC class I-restricted CD8 T cell responses. The goal of vaccination is to produce a memory of the vaccine antigen, so that if an individual is exposed to the pathogen in the future, the memory cells will recognize it and the immune system will be able to respond more effectively than if it had never encountered the pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.10.3"><label>3.10.3</label><title>Marketed drugs</title><p id="p1270">A few examples of marketed vaccines include Flumist&#174; Quadrivalent, Gardasil&#174; and BioThrax&#174;.

As biological processes become elucidated and novel drug platforms continue to be discovered, classical small-molecule approaches are not always appropriate or adequate and so other types of modalities are required to address these targets (e.g. protein&#8211;protein and protein&#8211;nucleic acid interactions). From an occupational safety perspective, this means staying current with the emerging literature on the hazards observed and expected with therapeutics spanning multiple modalities. Occupational safety professionals must be proactive and aware of the pharmacological, toxicological and physicochemical characteristics of the new modalities residing within their respective drug development pipelines to ensure occupational exposures are appropriately controlled and the risk of adverse effects, both pharmacological and toxicological, in the workplace is minimized. Occupational exposure control banding systems represent an acceptable approach to ensuring the safe handling of many new modalities, however it is important to be aware that certain modalities do not fit historical banding paradigms and require other means of classification, such as BSLs or BCCs.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Funding sources</title><p id="p1315">This research was funded by <funding-source id="gs1">Bristol Myers Squibb</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p1320">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Ader</surname><given-names>A.W.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Farris</surname><given-names>J.P.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ku</surname><given-names>R.H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Occupational health categorization and compound handling practice systems&#8212;roots, application and future</article-title><source>J.
