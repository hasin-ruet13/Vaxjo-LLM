It has been highly touted as a potential antiviral drug for COVID-19. It has been shown to have potent in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.77&#160;&#956;M <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>), SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Because of its high selectivity for viral polymerases, Remdesivir is less likely to cause toxicity in humans. The drug also exhibits a high genetic barrier to resistance in coronaviruses and its long intracellular half-life is conducive for once-a-day dosing <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. There are currently 38 registered trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov for investigating the efficacy of this drug. Preliminary results from a small cohort show clinical improvement in 68% of hospitalized patients <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> on administration of Remdesivir. However, the small sample size and the lack of a control group limit its significance. Wang et al. reported that in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial of 237 participants (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04257656">NCT04257656</ext-link>), Remdesivir did not exhibit significant clinical benefits <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. On April 29, the US NIH reported that in a high powered RCT of 1063 participants, patients in the Remdesivir group had shown a 31% faster time to recovery (median 11&#160;days) <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> than those in the placebo group (15&#160;days) (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001). Even though the findings do not definitively reveal whether the drug is curative, Remdesivir is slated to be the new standard of care <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> for COVID-19 patients in the United States. It has also been approved for therapeutic use in COVID-19 patients by the regulatory bodies of Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Europe <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The use of Remdesivir might prove to have a measurable impact on healthcare capacity by minimizing the length of hospital stay and reducing the overall severity of the illness. In a comparative analysis of the Phase 3 SIMPLE-severe trial and a retrospective cohort study of severe COVID-19 patients, Remdesivir has recently shown a 62% reduction in the risk of mortality as opposed to the standard of care and an improvement in clinical recovery <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

The drugs have recently gained notoriety due to much sociopolitical hype that has led to a spate of newly launched clinical trials- more than 240 studies are currently underway around the world. There is very limited data to advocate the use of HCQ/CQ as therapeutic options in COVID-19. In a small open-label non-RCT of 36 patients (20 treated/ 16 controls), significantly improved virologic clearance was observed in the HCQ (N&#160;=&#160;14) group. All six patients in the HCQ plus Azithromycin group had significantly better viral clearance <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. However, six patients in the HCQ group were removed from the study due to adverse effects or intolerance of the medication. A study in Brazil (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04323527">NCT04323527</ext-link>) was forced to prematurely halt patient recruitment due to the high fatality rate in the CQ group <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The authors of the study opined that treatment providers should refrain from administering high doses of CQ to critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards. There was also no reported evidence of a decrease in viral load or improvement in other clinical outcomes. A recent multinational observational study on more than 96,000 patients across six continents reported an increased occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients who received hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or in conjunction with macrolides <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The authors reported that the drug regimen did not have any beneficial effect on treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients, and exhibited an increased risk of mortality in the treatment group as compared to the control. HCQ/CQ has several potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR), such as the risk of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., QT prolongation), GI Disturbances, ECG abnormalities, hypoglycemia, and retinal damage upon long-term/high dose use. In a recent single-center study on 2541 patients, treatment with HCQ alone and HCQ&#160;+&#160;Azithromycin demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. However, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial which tested HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis did not find the drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19 after a high-risk exposure <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Hydroxychloroquine was discontinued from the RECOVERY trial owing to no evidence of beneficial effect on either mortality or clinical improvement outcomes <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. The WHO also discontinued the Hydroxychloroquine trial arm of the SOLIDARITY trial as it did not produce any reduction in mortality of COVID-19 patients when compared to the standard of care <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.

In CP therapy, blood plasma of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 is transfused into patients who are currently ill, in the hope that the freshly-made antibodies will help overcome the virus. Convalescent plasma has previously been used in the treatment of viral diseases such as poliomyelitis, influenza, SARS, and MERS. A case series of five critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS reported clinical improvements after the administration of convalescent plasma <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Another study on ten severely ill patients in China showed that the clinical symptoms improved significantly within three days, and that the viral load was undetectable after seven days of transfusion <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. A recent study on more than 20,000 COVID-19 patients who received CP therapy reported that transfusion of CP is safe and does not heighten the risk of adverse events <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. The study also indicated a reduction in mortality after transfusion of CP. Ianevski et al. reported on the differential nature of immune reactions to COVID-19 in different patients and suggested that the ability of CP to elicit a neutralizing immune response might wane with time <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. More than 130 listed trials are in progress across the world to gather stronger evidence that would warrant the use of plasma therapy. Plasma banks for the transfusion of CP from freshly recovered COVID-19 patients have been set up in several countries, including India, to counter the rapidly increasing number of cases <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Adverse effects associated with plasma transfusion include pathogen transmission and allergic transfusion reactions. The greatest obstacle for a large scale rollout of plasma therapy is to find prospective donors with high levels of neutralizing antibody titer (&gt;1:640) <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Studies on SARS have reported that the level of specific neutralizing antibodies titer decreased rapidly within four months of recovery <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, suggesting that immune protection may wane over time. Such short-lasting humoral immune response suggests that plasma from recently recovered patients is more effective for plasma therapy. The presence of antibodies points to a past infection. However, further research is needed to know more about the type and concentration of virus-neutralizing antibodies that protect against a new infection, and the duration for which the immunity might last. Current data is still insufficient on whether mild or asymptomatic infections generate adequate antibody responses or protection to COVID-19.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0190"><label>12</label><title>Vaccines</title><p id="p0140">Vaccination is the best bet for COVID-19 control. DNA plasmids, epitopes, mRNA, and artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) are some of the biotechnological platforms on which the hunt for a global vaccine is based <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines for COVID-19. There is limited information on the specific antigens used in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Most candidate vaccines are aimed at inducing neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike (S) protein, which prevents its uptake via the ACE2 receptor. <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
provides an overview of the global landscape of COVID-19 vaccine development activity for active clinical trials <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. The chain of events from conception to market availability of a vaccine usually takes over ten years, and has a mere 6% probability of successful market entry <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. If a commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were to be made available for use in 12&#8211;18&#160;months, assuming its path from the lab to the market is unhindered, it would represent a seismic change from the traditional vaccine development pathway. This would require a multipronged strategy involving novel vaccine development paradigms, flexible development phases, ramping up existing manufacturing capacity, unprecedented scale and speed of global R&amp;D, and radical changes in regulatory processes. It will also require careful evaluation of safety and efficacy every step of the way.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0010" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently enrolled in active clinical trials.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Name</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Platform</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Allocation &amp; Masking</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Developer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clinical Trial Status</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Strength</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Trial Location</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Estimated Date of Completion</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>mRNA 1273</bold></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA vaccine encoding S protein.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Randomized; Double blind</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Moderna/National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Phase II trial (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04405076">NCT04405076</ext-link>)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">600</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">United States</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">August 2021</td><td rowspan="8" colspan="1"><xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Lentiviral Minigene Vaccines (LV-SMENP-DC</bold>)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) used to modify dendritic cells (DCs) and to activate T cells.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Non-Randomized; Open Label</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Phase I (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04276896">NCT04276896</ext-link>)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Shenzen, China</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">December 31, 2024</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) live-attenuated vaccine*</bold></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Live-attenuated vaccine that induces a broad immune-system response.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Randomized; Open Label<break/>AND<break/>Randomized; Quadruple</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Murdoch Children's Research Institute;<break/>And<break/>UMC Utrecht</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Phase III BRACE trial - (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04327206">NCT04327206</ext-link>)<break/>AND<break/>Phase III BCG-CORONA trial - (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04328441">NCT04328441</ext-link>)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4,170 (Australia)<break/>AND<break/>1500 (Netherlands)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Australia<break/>AND<break/>The Netherlands</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">March 30, 2022<break/>AND<break/>December 25, 2020</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>INO-4800</bold></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">DNA plasmid vaccine.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Non-Randomized; Open Label</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Inovio Pharmaceuticals<break/>AND<break/>Coalition For Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Phase I (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04336410">NCT04336410</ext-link>)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Philadelphia and Kansas City, USA</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">April 2021</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>AD5-nCov</bold></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Recombinant non-replicating viral vector vaccine.

First, the review only included studies conducted on individuals aged 18 or above. Thus, findings from the studies might not always be generalizable to the pediatric population. Second, the search was limited to only English-language articles which might have been a bottleneck because much of the early data on COVID-19 came from studies which were based in China.</p></sec><sec id="s0215"><label>16</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0175">In summary, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious novel coronavirus that has rapidly brought about a global pandemic, destroying lives and livelihood at an alarming pace. Even though much is known about its genetic sequence and virology due to our knowledge of its predecessors, several questions regarding the epidemiological properties, transmission and pathogenesis remain unanswered. Animal studies and clinical trials on therapeutics directed against immunopathologic host responses are needed to elucidate the full spectrum of damage caused by this pathogen. Repurposing of existing drugs and the use of non-pharmacological therapies such as Convalescent Plasma are currently the best treatment avenues until a safe and efficacious vaccine is discovered. Although certain prospective agents listed in this review are promising, definitive evidence regarding their effectiveness remains inconclusive. COVID-19 has emerged to be a formidable adversary to the very existence of life as we know it. Overcoming these tough times requires the concerted efforts of people from all walks of life. It necessitates extensive international collaboration between academia, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, policymakers, public health organizations and philanthropic associations.
