The development of vaccine and its immediate application might be the only to escape from the grasp of this demoniac pandemic. Approximately 343 clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines are ongoing currently, and almost all countries are motivating ongoing researches at warp speed for the development of vaccines against COVID-19. This review explores the progress in the development of the vaccines, their current status of ongoing clinical research, mechanisms, and regulatory approvals. Many pharmaceutical companies are already in the endgame for manufacturing various vaccines of which some are already being marketed across the globe, while others are yet to get approval for marketing. The primary aim of this review is to compare regulatory accepted vaccines in terms of their composition, doses, regulatory status, and efficacy. The study is conducted by grouping into approved and unapproved vaccines for marketing. Different routes of administration of vaccines along with the efficacy of the routes are also presented in the review. A wide range of database and clinical trial data is reviewed for sorting out the information on different vaccines. Unfortunately, many mutations (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, kappa, omicron etc.) of SARS-CoV-2 have attacked people in very short time, which is the great challenge for investigational vaccines. Moreover, some vaccines like Pfizer&#8217;s BNT162, Oxford&#8217;s ChAdOx1, Moderna&#8217;s mRNA-1273, and Bharat Biotech&#8217;s Covaxin have got regulatory approval in some countries for its distribution which may prove to stand tall against the pandemic.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2">

COVID-19 has become demoniac day by day and with a present death rate of 4%. This intensified global spread and death rate have caused significant impacts, both short and long term, on society, economy, and politics. The term &#8220;COVID-19&#8221; is coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th February 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). On this account, the WHO reported that COVID-19 is the most recent, which is very infectious disease occurred by currently found coronavirus. There are several characteristic differences between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the new CoV. Here in this case, the death rate is lower than that of the reported cases of SARS, but the rate of infected people is greater in the case of COVID-19. This new CoV is different from SARS and is named as &#8220;SARS-CoV-2&#8221; by the WHO and has the size range of 2.24&#160;&#181;m to 3.58&#160;&#181;m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). The beginning of it was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. The USA first pointed out inceptive symptoms, clinical features, characteristics, detection diagnosis, etc. of COVID-19 from the first hospitalized COVID-19 positive patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). In a case of pandemic, the term &#8220;waves&#8221; is used to refer to the number of rising cases or surge of outbreak by WHO. Scientists first used the term for denoting the peaks and valleys of case graph during Spanish flu outbreak in 1918. The first wave denotes the starting of rising of number of cases until the peak is reached. After attaining the peak, the rate of transmission declines gradually as many people get already infected and less people get affected over a period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). These waves of a pandemic are generally calculated by effective reproduction number <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>. This value signifies the number of individuals getting infected in real time during an epidemic outbreak. If the value of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> is more than 1 over a long period of time, that period of time is denoted as the upward slope of the wave, and if the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> value is less than 1, the period is denoted as the downward slope of the wave. After the first wave comes the second wave where there is the second surge of rising cases. This wave is deadlier than the initial one as more number of cases and mortality is observed in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). An ICMR study in India from 41 government hospitals concluded that there is 30% hike in mortality rate during the second wave compared to the first. During this period of pandemic, vaccines and treatments start to develop as scientists get more information about the virus, its transmission mechanism, and genetics.</p><p id="Par4">Unfortunately, till date, no vaccines are available for complete prevention of this disease. Several clinical trials are ongoing with the aim to establish the safety and efficacy against this disease. These potential vaccines have different mechanisms of action, i.e., some are targeting the mRNA sequence of the virus or spike (S) glycoprotein of the virus, while others are targeting S2 subunit of it and some are also aiming to reduce the cytokine storm in the human body. While developing these vaccines, it is observed that in the case of mechanism of action, both structural and biological aspects of targeting are playing significant roles. Researchers and pharmaceutical industries of all over the world are involved in preclinical or clinical testing of potential new molecules for the prevention and of COVID-19.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, the WHO published a landscape detail of vaccines in which 23 vaccines are in clinical trial and 140 candidates are in preclinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Different departments of the US federal government have established a partnership, namely, Operation Wrap Speed (OWS), in which the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has collaborated with 18 pharmaceutical industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). Under the criteria of OWS, the US federal government is funding for phase 3 trial of 3 investigational vaccines which include mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Inc.) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford University). These are already approved by the USFDA (fast track approval) and the UK regulators and ethical reviewers along with regulatory authority of Brazil (Anvisa), respectively. In India, Zydus Cadila has obtained the approval for its vaccine candidate, namely, &#8220;ZyCoV-D&#8221; from Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to initiate phase 1/2 clinical trials [CTRI/2020/07/026352] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). After getting positive result in preclinical study on mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits, ZyCoV-D is moving towards phase 1/2 study.

This review mainly throws light on the current status of clinical trials of the vaccine candidates against COVID-19 along with their different aspects of targeting, i.e., biological (mRNA-1273 and DAS-181) or structural (Gam-COVID-Vac and Ad5-nCoV) or both (ChAdOx1 and INO-4800), current status of the approval of clinical trial from different regulatory authorities, and the current status of the Russian vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac/Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo, of which the developer has proclaimed that its trial is completed but has not provided any status for phase 3 trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). However, there are different SARS-CoV-2 variants like alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and kappa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). These variants are having different mutations in the S-glycoprotein. These mutations of different variants now become a challenge for approved as well as unapproved vaccines. Among these variants, delta (B.1.617.2) and kappa (B.1.617.1) originated from B.1.617.

id="Sec23"><title>SUITABLE ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION FOR COVID-19 VACCINES</title><p id="Par67">The route of administration for the vaccines is very much important because based on the route, immunity will be provided to some specific organs. From the traditional period, parenteral vaccines are common. Parenteral route provides stimulation of helper T cells and for which immune system will be boosted up. In a study, it was observed that parenteral vaccines are very much effective and provide long-term effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>). Although maximum vaccines are administered through IM route, there are also options for intranasal route, subcutaneous route, and intradermal route. Sometimes, intradermal routes may be effective due to its low dose requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>). Intramuscular route only provides systemic immune response only in lower respiratory tract.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Comparison Between Intranasal, Intramuscular, and Intradermal Route</title><p id="Par68">Intranasal route provides local immunity in lower respiratory tract with systemic immunity, for which nasal shedding of the virus can be overcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>). This point can be proved by a study. In this study, adenovirus (Ad5-S-nb2) was administered through the intranasal route against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and there the point of local and systemic immunity was proved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>). Since SARS-CoV-2 attacks through the upper respiratory tract, it is very important to protect the nasal area. Although intranasal vaccination provides tissue resident memory T cells in the lung, which gives protection against SARS-CoV-2, T cell immune responses are lesser in the spleen, lymph node, and brain rather than that of IM route. On the other hand, subcutaneous vaccination provides tissue resident memory T cells in airway passage and memory T cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>). Mucosal site, especially respiratory mucosa route, is considered as one of the potential routes for entry of pathogens causing local effect and systemic effect by entering the blood circulation. Coronavirus is one of the major example, which enters the body through respiratory mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>). All approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are injected through intramuscular (IM) route, although a number of researches are going across the globe for the development of intranasal vaccines for the same. Ideally, vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 acting against the mucosal pathogens should induce mucosal immune responses, but it is considered that most of the IM vaccines are not much effective against the mucosal pathogens. However, many studies proved that vaccines developed for influenza and polio virus show mucosal immunity even after systemic administration, but this is not fully evaluated in case of coronavirus. Studies revealed that AstraZeneca vaccine protected against pneumonia but did not show any effect in the upper respiratory tract. Intranasal vaccine delivery was tested in both hamsters and rhesus monkeys. Researchers compared the effectiveness between intramuscular and intranasal vaccines in hamsters by dosing them with each of the type. Likely, in rhesus monkeys, 2 doses of intranasal vaccine were administered and were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 where it was observed that the monkeys developed antibodies equivalent to human recovered from COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>). Thus, the administration of intranasal vaccine results in the formation of the memory lymphocytes in the upper airway tract and prevents the virus going further into the lower airways and lungs.</p><p id="Par69">Bharat Biotech&#8217;s nasal COVID-19 vaccine, BBV154, got its permission for phase 1 human clinical trial from Central Drug Standard Control Organisation. BBV154 is an intranasal replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus SARS-CoV-2 vectored vaccine. The Hyderabad-based company, the maker of Covaxin is working on nasal vaccination shot, which can bring more immunity against the demoniac pathogen. As per developers of the vaccine, Bharat Biotech is leading its trials using the nasal vaccination as one of the booster shot after the administration of 2 doses of Covaxin. This could not only boost the mucosal immunity but also strengthen the IgG and IgA antibody production, further improving the immunity against the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>). Recently, in the month of August, BBV154 got regulatory green light for phase 2 trial, which was carried in healthy volunteers of 18 to 60&#160;years of age. Moreover, the intranasal vaccine possibly has the ability to activate other immunological pathways and should be taken as booster dose after 2 doses of Covaxin. Live adenovirus vectored vaccine is easy to manufacture and is estimated the nasal vaccine can meet the shortage issue across the country. The hope of light is the data regarding the ongoing trial might be available by the end of December 2021. In case of preclinical trial of ChAdOx1, it was observed that through the IM route, it can give protection against the virus but could not provide nasal shedding of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>). On the other hand, another study reveals a single dose of intranasal vaccination can provide better upper and lower respiratory tract protection rather than that of IM route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>). However, the efficacy of intranasal vaccination depends up on the dosage, because this route prevents the transmission and better herd immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>).</p><p id="Par70">Beside, intradermal route is also a potent route for vaccination. Inovio&#8217;s INO-4800 was administered intradermally through a USFDA-approved handheld electroporation device, namely, CELLECTRA&#174; 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>). It binds to ACE2 receptor and blocks S glycoprotein for boosting the T cell and neutralizing antibody and improved the immunity system in body.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>VACCINATION FOR CHILDREN</title><p id="Par71">The rapid development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines reached a historical milestone. Children, on a large-scale, got affected by the deadly virus leading to negative consequences directly and indirectly. These consequences forced the vaccine testing drive in young age groups. Canada on 5th May 2021 became the first country to approve vaccination for emergency use in children aged 12 to 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>). In fact, most of the vaccination drive still remains dormant in case of children above 12&#160;years of age, and only limited vaccination campaigns are carried for age group of below 20&#160;years. The lack of attention on vaccination of young age group is due to the fact that children are getting less affected by the virus, developing symptoms like low to moderate body temperature, influenza, and gastrointestinal manifestations. According to the WHO data, from 30 December 2019 to 6 September 2021, only 8% of total cases was made up by children of age below 15&#160;years. However, in rare cases, children get severely affected by COVID-19 and need intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>). One of the adverse outcome is termed as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which further develops multisystem disorders in the heart, eyes, kidneys, lungs, brain, and gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>).</p><p id="Par72">In March 2021, Pfizer and BioNtech announced the results of phase 3 trial of BNT162b2 on more than 2200 children aging from 12 to 18&#160;years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>). The result showed that 18 children who were found out to have symptoms of COVID 19 were all treated with placebo, hence proving 100% effectiveness of the vaccine. The data was submitted to FDA requesting emergency use authorization for children between 12 and 15&#160;years, which was granted later on October 2021. On the other hand, Moderna has submitted a similar data regarding the COVID vaccine and got permission from the European Medicine Agency for its use in children between 12 and 17&#160;years. Moreover, granting of permission from the FDA for the same is still awaited. Covaxin (Bharat Biotech), one of the three leading vaccine manufacturer in India, Bharat Biotech, submitted the result of phase 3 trial and requested granting of permission for its emergency use in children 2 to 18&#160;years of age. The phase 3 trial was conducted in 525 child volunteers and was found that the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in child volunteer were 77.8%. Bharat Biotech has submitted all the data regarding safety and efficacy of the vaccine to Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which is already thoroughly reviewed, by CDSCO and Subject Expert Committee (SEC) with positive recommendations (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Mechanism of action of ChAdOx1 (S-gp&#8201;=&#8201;S glycoprotein, Ab&#8201;=&#8201;antibodies)</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO2" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12249_2022_2247_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>CHALLENGES FOR VACCINE TO OVERCOME SARS-COV-2 MUTATIONS</title><p id="Par73">At present, different variants of SARS-CoV-2 have come. It is a great challenge for the present as well as upcoming vaccines to combat against them. Maximum present vaccines are developed based on the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The recurrent mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 is observed in this S glycoprotein. Phase 3 trials of the AD26.COV2.S and ChAdOx1 have been conducted in different locations. Among these, it is observed in South Africa trial that the efficacy of both vaccines is significantly lower against B.1.351 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>). Neutralizing efficacy of another potential vaccine BNT162b2 for B.1.351 (beta) variant is found 2/3 lower than its normal efficacy reported. In the clinical trial of mRNA-1273, it was observed that after both doses, the serum level of neutralizing antibody against B.1.351 variant is 6 times lower than the normal. A recent study also supports the statement. In a cohort batch of 417 participants, everybody is given the second dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>). Among them, 2 women are found infected again. They have been found with some new variants, which include, E484K, T95I, del142-144, and D614G. These results indicate that there is potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection even after full vaccination. In case of variants, deadlier one is B.1.617.2 (delta), which is spreading very fast in different countries like the UK, India etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>). Different mutations under delta are very much dangerous which include L452R, T19R, del157-158, G142D, D614G, P681R, T478K, and D950N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>). Another variant is B.1.617.1 (kappa). Different mutations of kappa variant are G142D, T95I, E154K, E484Q, L452R, D614G, P681R, and Q1071H. Among these mutations, P681R is very much harmful. Apart from that, some more new variants B.1.1.7 or alpha (first detected in the UK in 26.2% COVID situations), B.1.526 (first detected in New York in 42.9% COVID cases), P.1, or gamma (first detected in Brazil) are now responsible for 72% COVID cases worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>). Some harmful mutations of alpha variant against which vaccine efficacy is very less are N501Y, del69-70, del144, A570D, P681H, D1118H, T716I, and S982A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>). In a recent study, the efficacy of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 is compared against alpha (B.1.1.7) and delta (B.1.617.2) variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>). The variants were detected by the sequencing of gene and status of S glycoprotein. It was a test negative case&#8211;control study, i.e., the participants had COVID-19 symptoms and tested (RTPCR) negative. These participants were given two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 to compare their efficacy against alpha and delta variant. After the first dose of both vaccines, it was observed that the efficacy is very much lower against delta variant (30.7% and 95% CI) than that of alpha variant (48.7% and 95% CI). After two doses of BNT162b2, the efficacy against the delta variant was found to be 88% (95% CI), and against the alpha variant, it was found to be 93.7% (95% CI). On the other hand, after two doses of ChAdOx1, the efficacy against delta variant was found to be 67% (95% CI), and against alpha variant, it was 74.5% (95% CI). The results clearly indicate that the delta variant is more dominant rather than the other variants, and it is a great challenge for the researchers to develop any vaccines against the delta variant. In another recent study, the efficacy of BNT162b2 against the alpha and beta variant was checked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>). In this case, at first test negative case&#8211;control study was conducted, and later, that data was further evaluated using a cohort study. In the former study, after 14&#160;days or more of the second dose, the efficacy of the vaccine against the alpha variant was found to be 89.5% (95% CI), and against the beta variant, it was 75% (95% CI). In this study, it was also observed that BNT162b2 was having highly combatting ability (97.4% efficacy with 95% CI) against severe or critical infection related to SARS-CoV-2. However, these values of efficacy were found slightly lower in the latter study. In the cohort study, the efficacy of the vaccine against the alpha variant was found to be 87% (95% CI), and against the beta variant, it was 72.1% (95% CI). Another study reveals the lower efficacy of ChAdOx1 against the alpha variant, specifically found in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>). The study was a multicentered, single-blinded, randomized, cohort, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), which was conducted in the UK. In this case, a total 8534 adult male and female participants were taken. Their COVID-19 test has been done by nucleic acid amplification test and after collection of swab genome sequencing was performed, which confirmed that it was alpha variant. In this study, it was observed that the efficacy of the vaccine against alpha variant in adults was 78% (95% CI) and specifically in women was 59% (95% CI). The result clearly indicates that ChAdOx1 is not very much effective against the alpha variant. After vaccination, it is necessary to release the neutralized antibodies. Unfortunately, some mutations like E484K mutation of the beta variant inhibits the neutralized antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>). Recently, another new variant is reported in South Africa on 24 November 2021. This B.1.1.529 or&#160;<italic toggle="yes">Omicron</italic>&#160;variant is found with a number of concerned mutations. The susceptibility of spreading in case of omicron is found higher rather than delta or delta plus variant. In South Africa, it is mainly found in the bodies of youngsters. The most dangerous thing is that the conventional process of RTPCR cannot detect this variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>).&#160;Therefore, it is a great challenge for the developer to develop any vaccine against these emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="Par74">The efficacy of some approved and unapproved vaccines against different SARS-CoV-2 variants are given in the

and most importantly consistency of action over its whole life cycle (can be ranged from 1 to 3&#160;years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>). The production time varies for different vaccines, for example, the production time of vaccines for influenza virus can be up to 3&#160;years. Permissions from regulatory bodies should be taken for that vaccine along with all the processes adopted for its production. Both in <italic toggle="yes">vitro</italic> and in <italic toggle="yes">vivo</italic> studies are required for checking its action, for which clinical trials should be done. The modification of these can be a cause of lower potency of the vaccine, which is the biggest challenge for vaccine production. In case of in <italic toggle="yes">vivo</italic> study, suitable animal model selection and safety monitoring (role of clinical research officer or CRO) in the clinical trial as well as conducting it for a pandemic disease (mainly the less time) are one of the biggest challenges for researchers. It&#8217;s difficult to predict where and when outbreaks will occur and to prepare trial sites to coincide with vaccine readiness for testing. Another big challenge for vaccine production is to respond against different pandemic diseases. In these cases, the time for vaccine production is generally expedited than the normal course. Several pandemic diseases have come worldwide, of which the responsible virus belonged to the coronavirus family like SARS and MERS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>). In these cases, there were no any single vaccines which can combat effectively against any one of them. For example, there was vaccine for influenza in world, but this pandemic threat had different strains for which a single vaccine was not effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>). For this reason, it was important to produce new vaccines within a short period during that emergency condition, which was a very big challenge for researchers. However, it took 4 to 6&#160;months to produce a new vaccine for this disease. In all the pandemic situations, researchers took several months to find new vaccines along with their safety and efficacy. In pandemic situations, regulatory authorities play a vital role in case approval of these vaccines. When the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declares the condition as an emergency, then the USFDA goes for fast track approval process or emergency use authorization. In this case, they approve the product which was not approved yet or the product which is approved for different case but is having action against the pandemic threat. As an example, the pandemic situation due to A/H1N1 can be taken which was occurred in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>). In this case, the USFDA approved a respirator, antiviral treatment, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic test as emergency use authorization. In the present day, SARS-CoV-2 becomes demoniac day by day of which the vaccine is not available, but several are in phase 3 clinical trial. This virus is having different strains, and it can undergo into the mutation, which is another challenge for the researchers in case of vaccine development because due to the mutation the desired therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine will be reduced. It reported three types of genome of this virus, i.e., type A, B, and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>). They proclaimed that the variant of SARS-CoV-2 found from the bats and pangolin is very much similar to type A, but this was not found predominant in Wuhan, China. The variant found in the USA and Australia is the mutated version of type A. Type B mainly predominates the region of Wuhan, China, and the East Asia because it is immunologically or according to environment adapted by the people live there, and type C is facing by the European countries like England, Sweden, France, and Italy. Mainly, variant C is derived from variant B. For this reason, a single vaccine will not be effective against this virus. Another challenge is the potential duration of the immunity, which is unknown. A recent study in <italic toggle="yes">Nature Medicine</italic> shown that the COVID-19 vaccines can save people up to a few days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>). Researchers of China conducted this study on some COVID-19 patients, of whom some were symptomatic and some were asymptomatic. After vaccination, researchers were consistently observing the immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM level, where they observed that IgG level decreased significantly after 8&#160;weeks sharp of recovery in asymptomatic patients (71% drop) and in symptomatic patients (76% drop) and levels of antibody dropped in 40 and asymptomatic and 13% symptomatic patients. Despite having a smaller number of patients, the result of this experiment raises a question regarding the lasting of the effect of COVID-19 vaccines. The dose of the vaccine is also an important factor for the researchers, i.e., whether it is single dose or multiple doses. Although the virus&#8217;s spike protein is a promising immunogen for protection, optimizing antigen design is critical to ensure optimal immune response. Though some high-income countries may pay for the development and manufacture with their own populations in mind, there is no global entity responsible for financing or ordering vaccine manufacture. On this account globally, fair vaccine-allocation system also creates challenge for researchers. A global financing system that supports end-to-end development and large-scale manufacturing and deployment that ensures fair allocation and protect private sector partners from significant financial losses will be a critical component of future pandemic preparedness. However, the scientific challenges for the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine are described in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<fig id="Fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Scientific challenges for the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO5" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="12249_2022_2247_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p id="Par76">The current status of all the aforesaid vaccines is summarized in Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Recently, the WHO published a landscape detail of vaccines in which 35 vaccines are in clinical trial and 194 candidates are in preclinical trial. The hope still remains as 21 vaccines are already in use for general public and 10 vaccines are in phase 4 of clinical trial worldwide. ChAdOx1, backed by the Oxford University and AstraZeneca as novel coronavirus vaccine, is one of the leading candidates reached global pharmaceutical market by the beginning of 2021 and was available to general public by the mid of 2021. Another potential candidate for corona virus vaccine, BNT162b2, backed by Pfizer and BioNTech, and Moderna&#8217;s mRNA-1273, are already approved in the UK and the USA for distribution. The regulatory authorization is obtained, and initial 800,000 doses began to roll out in the beginning of December 2020. Presently, a good number of vaccines across the globe have got approval for Investigational New Drug (IND). According to clinicaltrials.gov 343, clinical trials are ongoing for COVID-19 vaccine, of which some notable vaccines are Novavax&#8217;s NVX-CoV2373 (phase 3), CureVacc&#8217;s CVnCoV (phase 2b/3), University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children&#8217;s Research Institute&#8217;s Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (phase 2/3), and many more. As per clinical trial registration, the potent vaccines are likely to be launched in global market by 2021 to 2024. The good among the odds is that being an emergency drug, the infectious disease vaccine candidates pass the drug regulatory approval process at consistently higher rates than other drug types. Further, the race to develop COVID-19 vaccine has led a debate on minimum efficacy of vaccines among scientists, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies as 50% being the minimum efficacy recommended by the WHO for COVID-19 vaccine. Russian vaccine has entered the market with emergency authorizations even before the mandatory phase 3 clinical trials leading to alarming safety and efficacy issues. There are different variants, and a few specific vaccines are found to be effective against them. Oxford&#8217;s ChAdOx1 (double-dose) and Bharat Biotech&#8217;s Covaxin (double-dose) are found effective against delta and delta plus variants, respectively. With some constraints, most of the vaccines have been found safe and effective against SARS-CoV-2 in phase 2 clinical trials, and some of these are able to produce robust immunomodulatory effect, which shows a light of hope for their successful phase 3 trials followed by speedy launching of vaccines in global market.<fig id="Fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.
