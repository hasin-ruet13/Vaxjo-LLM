Initial denials of human-to-human transmission of the virus, which were later refuted in January 2020, led to a rapid spread of the disease throughout China within a short span of time. Following this, the virus quickly spread both within China and across the globe with more than 210 countries affected.</p><p id="p0015">In January 2020, the first genome sequence of the virus was released by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang (GenBank accession no. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="MN908947">MN908947</ext-link>). Based on its genome sequence similarity to SARS coronaviruses, it was identified as a novel coronavirus and was named SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses refer to the largest group of viruses characterized by a spherical morphology with a single-stranded RNA surrounded by an outer envelope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;1</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, one of four genera of coronaviruses, which also includes SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) -CoV (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#160;2</xref>) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Similar to the present scenario, jumping of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) from animals to humans has wreaked havoc in the past, mainly as a result of the inability of our immune system to fight against the new enemy.<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig.&#160;1</label><caption><p>(a) Schematic structure of virion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with genomic RNA and its major structural proteins.

It is primarily transmitted by infected people while coughing, sneezing or even talking to healthy individuals through inhalation of droplets or aerosols. As the virus can survive on inanimate surfaces for some time (a few hours to a few days), it can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces with bare hands through hand to nasal, oral or even eye contact [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, as it had spread to more than 120 countries by that time [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In any given region of the world, the disease first originates as a small number of imported cases (Stage 1) with subsequent clusters of cases defined by common exposure (Stage 2) which, if not quarantined properly, leads to community transmission (Stage 3) followed by a widespread outbreak in public (Stage 4). Community transmission refers to a stage when the source of infection is not known for most cases. The spread and severity of any infectious disease is quantified by the transmission rate (R<sub>0</sub>) and the case fatality rate (CFR), which refer to the number of newly infected people from a single case and the per cent of cases resulting in death, respectively [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The R<sub>0</sub> and CFR % values for COVID-19 are 2.0&#8211;2.5 and 2.3%, respectively, as estimated by WHO in February 2020. The current statistics claims that these values could be &#8764;1.5&#8211;3.5 and &#8764;3.4%. However, these data are being revised continuously because of differences in the global scenario, rapidly growing new cases and unaccounted asymptomatic cases [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The most common symptom of COVID-19 is fever or chills, along with other symptoms such as cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of smell or taste, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, sputum production and loss of appetite (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#160;1</xref>) [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, these symptoms overlap with common flu or other viral fevers, making it difficult to diagnose the disease on the basis of symptoms alone. To add to this complication, most cases (&gt;80%) remain asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Around 20% of infected individuals progress to more serious or critical conditions like severe pneumonia accompanied by multi-organ failure, among which some may succumb to death (3%&#8211;4%) [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The existence of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy has also gained significant prominence, following the exhibition of various neurological manifestations by a significant proportion of patients. Ischaemic stroke, cerebral haemorrhage and thrombosis are some of the more common symptoms [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, mortality to a larger extent is also determined by access to quality health care. According to the global data, as well as the early estimates from China, both old age and co-morbidities may render individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease or dying from COVID-19, perhaps because of weaker immune function [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;1</label><caption><p>A rough time-line of progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Table&#160;1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 1<xref rid="tbl1fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Fever in 88% of infected cases, often accompanied by fatigue, nausea or diarrhoea</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 2&#8211;4</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Fever with dry cough and muscle pain</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 5&#8211;6</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">+ Breathing difficulties</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 7&#8211;8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Recovery for some patients; however, hospitalization may be needed for patients with severe conditions (&#8764;15%), may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome due to fluid accumulation in the lungs</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 9&#8211;11</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Some cases may worsen needing admission to the intensive care unit</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 12&#8211;14</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">For most cases fever ends but coughing may persist</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 13&#8211;14</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">For patients headed towards recovery, breathing problems may end at this stage</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Day 17&#8211;18</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Full recovery; however, in some cases (5%) it may lead to death</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fna"><label>a</label><p id="ntpara0010">&#8216;Day 1&#8217; refers to the appearance of the first symptom.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="p0030">The time between the onset of infection and appearance of the first symptom of the disease in an individual is defined as the incubation period. SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is typically around 5&#8211;6 days (ranging from 0&#8211;14 days) [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which is similar to its distant cousin, SARS-CoV (4&#8211;6 days and up to 10 days in some cases) [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Apart from the high mortality rate (11%) of SARS, one of the factors contributing to the limited transmissibility in the SARS outbreak of 2002 could be the lack of transmission during the incubation period [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This made it possible to isolate the infected individuals at an early stage, so significantly fewer people were infected globally. In contrast, although SARS-CoV-2 is most contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, transmission may take place even during presymptomatic or asymptomatic stages, making it an &#8216;invisible enemy&#8217;, allowing each infected person to potentially infect several others [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Life cycle of SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="p0035">A virus is a non-living obligate parasite that multiplies only after its entry into host cells. The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 begins in the lungs, where it infects alveolar type II cells. The SARS-CoV-2 attaches to cells by binding to the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the cell membrane through its spike (S) protein, which is expressed on the viral surface [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The conformational change in S protein as a result of binding promotes entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, largely by endocytosis. The S protein acts like a key, locking on to the ACE2 receptor; this makes it entry into the cell possible. Once inside the cell, the virus releases its genetic material, a single-stranded RNA, and starts synthesis of viral replicase polyproteins using the host machinery. These polyproteins are cleaved to smaller fragments by viral proteinases and then assemble in to the RNA-dependent RNA replicase complex. The replicase complex synthesizes more copies of viral RNA and a series of smaller sub-genomic RNAs, which are translated into the viral proteins on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane using host translation machinery. The fresh copies of the genomic RNA and the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins synthesized are finally packed into new viral particles or virions, which are then released outside the cell by exocytosis or pyroptosis [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">The newly formed SARS-CoV-2 virions can infect a large number of healthy lung cells, thereby continuing the cycle. The virions are recognized by alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells and by macrophages. The cellular interactions of this virus with these cells trigger the release of cytokines, which then signal certain types of immune cells, such as T cells, monocytes and macrophages, and promote inflammation. In most cases, the immune system responds by producing T cells, which kill SARS-CoV-2 while the neutralizing antibodies produced by B cells block the S protein&#8211;ACE2 receptor interaction, thereby inhibiting further spread to the other organs, leading to patient recovery. In contrast, in a weak immune response, there is accumulation of immune cells in the lungs leading to production of a disproportionate level of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in cytokine storm. In parallel, the uncontrolled rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other organs triggers multi-organ failure and even death [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An analysis of 326 individuals with COVID-19 from China showed that the elderly and patients with low levels of T cells and high levels of the cytokine interleukin-6 were found to have more severe symptoms [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Global variants and disease severity</title><p id="p0045">A virus genome may accumulate mutations while it replicates inside the host cell, thereby generating genomic variants across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 mutates, albeit at a slow rate [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Characterization of these variants may be helpful in understanding the disease mechanism, how the virus evades the immune system or how it develops resistance to drugs. However, it would be premature to infer from the currently available data that a particular mutation makes the virus more virulent. A recent study found two major versions of SARS-CoV-2, called clade I and clade II, based on the genome sequence analysis of more than 100 sequences [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The two clades were not found to be any different in terms of contagiousness or disease severity. The disease severity largely depended on host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm, not so much on the viral genetic variation [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In an independent study, researchers found three blood-based biomarkers that can predict disease severity at least 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy, based on a database of 485 infected patients from Wuhan, China. Based on these results, the disease severity was found to be associated with a high level of lactate dehydrogenase, low lymphocyte level and increased amount of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">Phylogenetic analysis of different variants could also help in tracing the route of the virus across the globe. A large-scale analysis based on the sequences of 3067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed a clonal geo-distribution and several mutation hotspots on the genome [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Information about the mutation hotspots could be critical in both therapeutics and vaccine design so that the genomic regions showing higher mutation rates could be avoided as drug targets or in vaccine design.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Diagnostic strategies</title><p id="p0055">According to the WHO, as the symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with those of the common cold and influenza, laboratory testing is the only way for confirmation of COVID-19. For this reason, testing or diagnosis is an essential step in patient screening for COVID-19 and achieving control over the global pandemic. All the testing strategies have a common aim, which is to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an individual. The testing strategies can be broadly classified into two types: (a) detection of the virus itself either by RNA/DNA-based approaches or viral antigen detection, and (b) detection of the antibodies produced in response to the viral infection.</p><p id="p0060">Among DNA/RNA-based approaches, quantitative RT-PCR is the reference standard method that detects the presence of viral RNA using RT-PCR. This approach is highly sensitive because it involves amplification of signal by exponentially increasing the target molecules. The specificity is controlled by designing primer probes specific to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. It is being used worldwide for confirmation of virus presence in patients' nasal/throat swabs. An alternative approach combines isothermal amplification of target with a CRISPR-based detection method [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, these approaches involve amplification of signal, which may give rise to non-specific off-target signal, thereby increasing the possibility of false positives. Also, these are costly, time-consuming and need technically trained staff and special infrastructure, such as clean room and expensive real-time PCR machines. Hence, the immediate priority would be to develop highly sensitive, specific and rapid, point-of-care COVID-19 detection strategies.</p><p id="p0065">At present, several research groups are trying to develop accurate, fast, field-compatible and reliable detection methods. Antibody-based antigen detection is one such rapid and cost-effective method. This is a lateral flow assay where monoclonal antibodies against the virus are used for rapid detection of the viral antigen in the patient samples. However, lower sensitivity of the assay remains a concern [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another commonly used rapid assay is the serological test, which detects the presence of antibodies in the patient's blood using labelled viral proteins [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although serology tests are rapid, comparatively easier to perform and require fewer laboratory skills, they can be only used from about 5 days after infection because the antibody titre produced by the body in response to infection develops only at a later stage (1 week for IgM and 2&#8211;3 weeks for IgG). Therefore, it can be used for initial screening of the population followed by a more confirmatory test like quantitative RT-PCR. Apart from its use for rapid detection of infection during the symptomatic period, the serological test could be used after the infection has receded, because the antibodies may remain in the blood for a longer period. This makes it a perfect tool for population studies to obtain more accurate transmission data worldwide, at a later stage of infection or recovery, to obtain a clear picture of the CFR of COVID-19. Though some of the presently available commercial serological tests have low specificity, it is possible to design highly specific tests by using peptides that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses.</p><p id="p0070">Several other novel approaches that are still under development and validation, are chip-based detection of viral RNA&#8211;DNA probe hybridization using electrical detection or immunoassays, and laser-based surface-enhanced Raman spectra. These are rapid, sensitive and appear promising; however, the major challenge would be to make them available at point of care.

Nevertheless, some of the steps where SARS-CoV-2 infection could be intercepted are: inhibition of S protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor and processing or functioning of polyprotein replicase [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Also, several generic antiviral agents are being tested for their effectiveness against COVID-19. An alternative strategy could be to decrease the severity of the symptoms by inhibiting the cytokine storm generated by the body's immune response.</p><p id="p0080">Drugs that are under clinical trials include remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-interleukin-6 antibody that inhibits cytokine storm by blocking the inflammatory protein interleukin-6 [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Only remdesivir has shown a positive outcome, with a modest increase in speed of recovery of treated patients, in the National Institutes of Health-funded randomized placebo control clinical trials [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Remdesivir will also be tested in combination with monoclonal antibodies in the subsequent trials. In the tocilizumab clinical trials, the end point will be to evaluate if the antibody treatment is able to reduce time on ventilators and in the intensive care unit for individuals with COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Treatment with a combination of the protease inhibitor drugs lopinavir and ritonavir did not show any benefits beyond standard care in hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Most of the therapeutic strategies are targeting the repurposing of drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, but there are certain novel candidates like lenzilumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody for alleviating pneumonia [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Clinical trials of plasma therapy using convalescent plasma from recovered patients for transfer of passive immunity have also been initiated both in India and the USA [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The malaria drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, which created a stir in the initial stages of the pandemic, failed to live up to expectations during clinical trials [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p id="p0085">Vaccines teach the immune system to fight against future infections, thereby conferring immunity. For most viral infections, prevention is considered better than cure. A good vaccine should be effective, safe and durable. During the 2002 SARS outbreak, attempts were made to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV; however, the rapid disappearance of the epidemic because of the low transmissibility of the virus decelerated the research and commercial interests in this direction, so we still do not have an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. At present, several strategies are being considered for development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccines could be based on DNA, RNA or protein, or could use a more conventional attenuated/killed virus based approach. More than 100 different vaccines are in the preclinical phase with at least five candidates being tested in clinical evaluation. Among the vaccines that are undergoing Phase II trials for clinical evaluation to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy are the non-replicating viral-vector-based vaccine (ChiCTR2000031781) developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and mass produced by CanSino Biologicals (Tianjin, China) [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and RNA-based vaccine (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04405076">NCT04405076</ext-link>) developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in association with Moderna (Cambridge, MA, USA) [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. But the candidate vaccine that has garnered a lot of attention because of its rapid progress, is the experimental vaccine (ChAdOx1-S) developed by Oxford University in association with AstraZeneca (Cambridge, UK). This vaccine is a non-replicating viral-vector-based vaccine and is the first to enter Phase III of clinical evaluation [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Another candidate vaccine (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT04456595">NCT04456595</ext-link>) developed by Sinovac (Beijing, China) has also recently entered Phase III clinical trials. It is based on the conventional inactivated virus approach using alum as an adjuvant [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Disease management strategies</title><p id="p0090">As there are no vaccines or approved effective treatments at present against COVID-19, different mitigation strategies have been employed by governments to curb the spread of and eventual deaths from the virus. Continuous attempts are being made to educate people with the correct information about the virus and the disease, as well as about maintaining good personal hygiene, such as frequent hand washing. Several myths related to COVID-19 have appeared on social media that need to be fact-checked. Some of them have been compiled here for better awareness among readers (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#160;2</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;2</label><caption><p>Myth busters [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0025">Table&#160;2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Myths</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Facts</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Warmer climates adversely affect SARS-CoV-2 survival and transmission</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">No reports of the temperature sensitivity of the virus, it spreads equally rapidly in warmer tropical countries like India and Pakistan</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Young and healthy individuals are immune and need not take strict precautionary measures</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Although fewer in number, there have been instances of serious illness and even deaths in young and healthy individuals.

Emphasis is also given to quarantine of infected individuals during early infection as well as to screening and isolating asymptomatic people, who can unknowingly spread the virus to others, using diagnostic testing. This is in parallel supported by contact tracing to isolate people who might have come in contact with the infected individuals. According to the WHO, the only way for confirmation of COVID-19 is testing. Continuous attempts are being made to improve the testing capabilities by increasing the numbers of testing centres/laboratories and training more people, some of the major bottle-necks are the lack of appropriate biosafety facilities to handle the viral samples, limited supply of the reagents and the high cost associated with the available testing reagents/kits/specialized equipment. Attempts are also being made to develop cost-effective and easy-to-use point-of-care tests.</p><p id="p0100">Though most scientists support the idea of physical distancing for flattening the curve, there is a parallel school of thought that says developing &#8216;herd immunity&#8217; against SARS-CoV-2 could be a way of controlling further infections. Herd immunity develops in a population when most individuals (at least &#8764;70%) acquire adaptive immunity against an infectious agent, either through vaccination or previous exposure, and will be able to protect others who are not yet immune to the virus [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This is an indirect way of developing immunity for an entire population, as the required number of hosts for the infectious agent would no longer be available, thereby reducing the spread. However, COVID-19 has a higher risk of manifestation into severe disease and death, with even higher probability of mortality in vulnerable groups. As a result, it is advised to space out the number of infections over time by physical distancing to avoid overburdening health-care workers and hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Conclusion and future perspectives</title><p id="p0105">The COVID-19 pandemic has affected countries worldwide causing irreparable damage to both human lives and the economy. One lesson we have learned from this pandemic is that a higher commitment to investment in research &amp; development, health-care infrastructure and diagnostics is needed for better preparedness in the future. This pandemic demands the combined action of research groups across the globe. It is equally important to evolve strong collaboration between the research sector, universities and the pharmaceutical industry in unprecedented ways to bring their collective strengths to a unified platform to fight this disease or similar future outbreaks. At present, the immediate priority is expediting the testing of vaccines and treatments; developing low cost, rapid, point-of-care diagnostics; and cheaper, reusable PPE.</p><p id="p0110">The biology of SARS-CoV-2 is evolving with each passing day, and we are far from fully understanding the disease mechanisms and SARS-CoV-2's interactions with our immune system. Biologists need to address basic fundamental questions about COVID-19, such as why patients respond differently to the disease, for how long the immune system of a recovered patient will give protection against re-infection, what are the chances of recurrence in recovered people, the effect of genomic mutations on virulence, rate of mutation and many more. Answers to these questions will be instrumental in the advancement of the therapeutics. The best case scenario for getting these solutions will take at least 12&#8211;18 months; sadly, we may have to live with our &#8216;invisible enemy&#8217; until then. At present, increasing testing and maintaining physical distancing, good hygiene and a healthy immune system could be only weapon for resuming our normal lives.</p></sec><sec
