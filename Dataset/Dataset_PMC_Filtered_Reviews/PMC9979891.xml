Efforts to develop therapeutics have led to innovations such as mRNA vaccines and oral antivirals. Here we provide a narrative review of the biologic therapeutics used or proposed to treat COVID-19 during the last 3&#160;years. This paper, along with its companion that covers xenobiotics and alternative remedies, is an update to our 2020 paper. Monoclonal antibodies prevent progression to severe disease, are not equally effective across variants, and are associated with minimal and self-limited reactions. Convalescent plasma has side effects like monoclonal antibodies, but with more infusion reactions and less efficacy. Vaccines prevent progression for a larger part of the population. DNA and mRNA vaccines are more effective than protein or inactivated virus vaccines. After mRNA vaccines, young men are more likely to have myocarditis in the subsequent 7&#160;days. After DNA vaccines, those aged 30&#8211;50 are very slightly more likely to have thrombotic disease. To all vaccines we discuss, women are slightly more likely to have an anaphylactic reaction than men, but the absolute risk is small.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords

</title><p id="Par2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory infection that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], or death.</p><p id="Par3">One year into the pandemic the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine, marking a shift in efforts from repurposing medications to widespread vaccination. One month later, the FDA issued EUAs for Moderna&#8217;s vaccine and for monoclonal antibodies designed to prevent disease progression in those infected with SARS-CoV-2 with mild symptoms and major comorbidities. The speed of development and effectiveness of vaccines has been matched by public resistance to receiving the vaccine and misinformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], mostly over-emphasizing the adverse effects of the vaccine and downplaying the risks of untreated COVID-19, a calculus that also changes with each variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">This narrative review describes the effects of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that a clinician is likely to encounter when treating patients affected by COVID-19. We focus on toxicity, not efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par5">In our previous publication we discussed the recombinant protein APN01, humanized antibody leronlimab, nucleotide analogs remdesivir and favipiravir, protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir, DNA vaccines (S-trimer, INO-4800, GLS-5300), the Moderna mRNA vaccine, and convalescent plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the last 2&#160;years, the monoclonal antibodies, protein vaccines, and more mRNA vaccines emerged. For each of these substances, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for any publications between May 1, 2020, and June 1, 2022 that mentioned the substance and contained the keywords &#8220;adverse event,&#8221; &#8220;secondary effect,&#8221; &#8220;unintended effect,&#8221; &#8220;adverse reaction,&#8221; &#8220;unintended reaction,&#8221; or &#8220;toxicity,&#8221; or their spelling variants, in the full-text of the paper. We considered papers tagged with MeSH Heading &#8220;Drug Toxicity&#8221; (D064420), also labeled as &#8220;Adverse Drug Event,&#8221; and all subheadings. This MeSH heading also includes all adverse drug reactions, which are the intersection of the MeSH tags D064420 and D004347 (&#8220;Drug Interaction&#8221;). We only considered peer-reviewed publications for which the full-text in English was available. We also included each vaccine&#8217;s application for Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA.</p><p id="Par6">We included substances we did not previously discuss, choosing based on the vaccines being recommended by the Center for Disease Control and our experience as practicing physicians and scientists. Our description of substances and their effects is not exhaustive and presents our knowledge as of June 2022. In the absence of direct evidence, we expect drugs of a similar class to have similar toxicity. Our search strategy may be biased towards mild and moderate effects, which are assiduously reported by clinical trials. We include case reports even though they cannot demonstrate causality, because they often provide the first description of severe toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Biology of Coronavirus Spike (S) Protein</title><p id="Par7">SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Coronavirinae family. Its genetic sequence resembles SARS-CoV-1, a beta-coronavirus that caused the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic in 2003. To date, vaccines have focused on raising immunity against the S protein, the protein SARS-CoV-2 uses to attach to and enter host cells. The S protein is an attractive target because it elicits an immune response and mutations in it may explain the variation in virulence across SARS-CoV-2 strains. It is a trimeric glycosylated transmembrane complex embedded in the lipid bilayer that surrounds the viral genome. Understanding the structure is important for understanding the toxicity of monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific parts of the S protein, which creates the potential for each monoclonal antibody to have unique off-target effects. The S protein is composed of a region that attaches to the ACE2 receptor (the receptor binding domain (RBD) or S1) and a region that facilitates fusion of the host and virus membranes (S2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The parts of the S protein mutate at different rates, explaining why the efficacies of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, which assume a specific S protein sequence, differ across SARS-CoV-2 variants. The S protein is glycosylated, which helps it evade detection by the immune system and tightly bind to ACE2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is challenging to develop antibodies against glycosylated proteins because the sugars coat the immunogenic protein and vary too frequently in structure to be themselves a viable target.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>COVID-19 Therapeutics</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>APN01</title><p id="Par8">APN01 is a recombinant human ACE2 protein first developed to treat SARS-CoV-1. It was hoped that APN01 would prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering the cell just as it did for the structurally similar SARS-CoV-1. The proposed mechanism was that APN01 would act as a decoy for the virus, much as andexanet alfa acts as a decoy for factor Xa inhibitors. A randomized unblinded clinical trial was reported underway in 2020 in the People's Republic of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We could find no toxicity data to present. Absent new data, we reiterate the general observation that toxicity from recombinant proteins results from inadvertently activating the immune system and off-target binding, which may manifest as type II or III hypersensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Convalescent Plasma</title><p id="Par9">Convalescent plasma is plasma pooled from those who contracted and then recovered from COVID-19. It is administered to patients who have contracted the disease and are at high risk for deterioration without intervention. The rationale behind convalescent plasma is like that for monoclonal antibodies, as convalescent plasma is a m&#233;lange of immunoglobulins. Case series report that self-limited chills and fevers are the main adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The general risks associated with plasma transfusion are acute lung injury, circulatory overload, allergic/anaphylactic reactions, transmission of infections, febrile hemolytic and non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, and RBC alloimmunization. An analysis of 50,000 hospitalized patients with COVID who received convalescent plasma through the FDA&#8217;s Early Access Program reported transfusion reactions (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;78), thromboembolic or thrombotic events (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;113, 75 judged unrelated), and cardiac events (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;677; 597 judged unrelated), mainly myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Monoclonal Antibodies</title><p id="Par11">Monoclonal antibodies supplement the body&#8217;s immune response by helping the body identify SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, in effect providing ready-made beacons to the immune system while it is developing its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In December 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for sotrovimab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], bamlanivimab/etesevimab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and casirivimab/imdevimab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to treat non-hospitalized immunosuppressed patients who are at high risk for progression of COVID-19 symptoms. Bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab bind to the receptor binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Sotrovimab binds to the S2 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Antibody toxicity can arise from an expected effect on the target, an immunologic response to the antibody, or from off-target binding. An example of of an expected but undesired effect is immunosuppression from infliximab, which targets TNF-alpha, leading to more frequent infections. Examples of an immunologic response to the antibody itself include hypersensitivity reactions, complement activation, and cytokine storm. Cytokine storm refers to fevers, chills, myalgias, and acute lung injury resulting from direct activation of various immunocompetent cells including macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, and natural killers (NK) cells. Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody used to treat head and neck cancer illustrates adverse effects from off-target binding. Cetuximab also binds to EGFR receptors in the skin leading to reactions as varied as pruritus, hirsutism, and xerosis. As another example, trastuzumab, an anti-her2 monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of breast cancer, binds to cardiac her2 receptors leading to dysrhythmias and cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Leronlimab (PRO 140)</title><p id="Par13">Leronlimab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that decreases IL-6 production by targeting the T cell CCR5 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To date, no clinical trials have been performed. Of 23 patients who received one subcutaneous injection of 700&#160;mg leronlimab on a compassionate use basis, 17 recovered at day 30 although IL-6 levels did not decrease after administration. Eighteen of the 23 were also receiving convalescent plasma, remdesivir, tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, or sarilumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Four patients with SARS-CoV-2 on mechanical ventilation and vasopressors were able to be extubated and weaned off pressors after receiving two infusions of 700&#160;mg leronlimab two weeks apart and IL-6 levels decreased, but these patients also received hydroxychloroquine, zinc, tocilizumab, remdesivir, and azithromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Neither publication presented data on adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Tocilizumab</title><p id="Par14">Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-6 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Macrophages secrete IL-6 when they detect an entity whose cell surface expresses pathogen associated molecular patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. IL-6 binding to IL-6R promotes the transcription of acute phase proteins, T cell differentiation, and antibody production. It was approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis by the FDA in 2010 and has been used to treat juvenile systemic idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, and cytokine release syndrome after CAR-T therapy.</p><p id="Par15">The rationale for using tocilizumab in COVID-19 is that IL-6 blockade could attenuate the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, which resembles cytokine storm. In 48 patients in Wuhan, China, IL-6 levels were correlated with the degree of SARS-CoV-2 viremia and an independent predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Of 592 adult patients with severe COVID-19, those who received tocilizumab had lower all-cause mortality compared to those who received saline (16 vs 24%; relative risk 0.62 [0.31&#8211;1.22]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Serious adverse events occurred in 103 of 295 patients (34.9%) in the tocilizumab group and in 55 of 143 patients (38.5%) in the placebo group. A meta-analysis of 32 studies (29 cohort studies and 3 clinical trials) found no difference in mortality or frequency of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">A retrospective trial of 1827 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized between March 14, 2020, and April 23, 2020, reported transaminase elevations five times above the upper limit of normal as an independent predictor of mortality in patients who received an unspecified combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and tocilizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The most common adverse events attributed to tocilizumab are an increased incidence of opportunistic infections, reflecting immunosuppression, and clinically insignificant dyslipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In June 2021 the FDA issued an EUA for tocilizumab in patients 2&#160;years or older hospitalized with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen who were also receiving corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The dose authorized is 12&#160;mg/kg for those less than 30&#160;kg and 8&#160;mg/kg up to 800&#160;mg for those heavier than 30&#160;kg. The diluent is 0.9% or 0.45% saline, and the solution is infused over 1&#160;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sotrovimab</title><p id="Par18">Sotrovimab is a recombinant IgG1-kappa made of 2 identical light and 2 identical heavy chains. Sotrovimab binds to a region in S2 that helps the host and virus membrane fuse. This region is conserved in SARS-CoV-2 across variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As of January 2022, sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal antibody believed effective against the omicron variant, illustrating the dependence of the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies on viral structure.</p><p id="Par19">The FDA issued an EUA for a one-time infusion of 500&#160;mg sotrovimab over 1&#160;h on May 26, 2021, for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients 12&#160;years or older, heavier than 40&#160;kg, and with at least one risk factor for progression of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].
