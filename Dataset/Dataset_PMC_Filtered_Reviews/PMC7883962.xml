COVID-19 is moderately infectious with a relatively high mortality rate, but the information available in public reports and published literature is rapidly increasing. It is caused by a virus initially known as &#8220;novel coronavirus 2019&#8221; (nCoV-2019) which was renamed as &#8220;SARS-CoV-2&#8221; by the international committee of the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although origin of the virus is not known, it is thought to be originated from bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus, with phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for investigational antiviral drug <italic toggle="yes">remdesivir</italic> for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with the severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although many medications are being tested, there are still limited therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients. Angiotensin receptor blockers, such as losartan, have also been suggested for the treatment of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. So, the best solution for controlling the pandemic will be the simultaneous application of sensitive diagnostic approaches, using current available drugs while still developing novel treatments, and above all the development of vaccines for long-term prevention of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. COVID-19 is a public health concern, and ongoing changes in the climate make upcoming occurrence of such pandemics more probable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8226;&#8226;]. As per the US CDC criteria, epidemiological factors are used to assess the requirement of testing for persons under investigation (PUI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] which include close contact with a laboratory-confirmed patient within 14&#160;days of symptoms or travel history to an infected area within 14&#160;days of symptom onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Therefore, antiviral drugs, antibiotics, and systemic corticosteroids are used as treatment. Likewise, the treatment is symptomatic in nature. Apart from the already discovered treatments being applied to combat COVID-19 and its associated complications, scientists are trying hard to develop new potential therapeutic strategies, consisting of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, peptides, interferon-based therapies, protease inhibitors, and small-molecule drugs to conquest the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therapeutics targeting spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) could be designed to combat COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Extensive studies on the identification of putative protease cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, their relative importance for SARS-CoV-2 S protein activation, viral pathogenesis, and cellular tropism have led to effective development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines which the human world was badly in need of at this time.</p><p id="Par15">The trimeric S protein of CoVs is cleaved by host cell proteases during infection to expose the fusion peptide of the S2 domain, which induces fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Cleavage of S protein occurs at different sites, identified in various CoVs to be between the S1 and S2 domains (S1/S2 site) and within the S2 domain proximal to the fusion peptide (S20 site). It is believed that cleavage at both sites is required for viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Different proteases that cleave S1/S2 site in various coronaviruses have been identified; their inhibitors termed <italic toggle="yes">protease inhibitors (PIs)</italic> are antiviral agents having therapeutic potential. The S1/S2 site (RSVR#SV) of MERS-CoV S protein is cleaved by furin after its biosynthesis during viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], whereas SARS-CoV S1/S2 site has been shown to be cleaved by cathepsin L following receptor binding and during viral entry in late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 has an S1/S2 site (AYT#M) that is identical to the one in SARS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and it is propounded that the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site may be cleaved by cathepsin L as in SARS-CoV. Other proteases such as trypsin, elastase, cathepsin L, and TMPRSS2 have been shown to cleave SARS-CoV S protein at other sites between S1 and S2 domains during viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This is supported by several studies which showed that cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 promote SARS-CoV entry, while their inhibition suppressed infection of permissive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has the same S20 site as SARS-CoV, it is proposed that processing of SARS-CoV-2 S protein at S20 site is similar to SARS-CoV. The membrane protein is pivotal to viral entry in the cell as reflected by in silico studies of the interactome, as TMPRSS2 is being downregulated by viral infection. The TMPRSS2 node is a potentially interesting region of the interactome and a target for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. It has been experimentally demonstrated that inhibition of TMPRSS2 with a protease inhibitor (camostat mesylate) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], making this protein an extremely promising target for antiviral therapy.</p><p id="Par16">In addition to the previous S1/S2 sites, SARS-CoV-2 has a furin-like protease cleavage S20 site (KR#SF) that is identical to that in SARS-CoV, though there is no evidence that SARS-CoV S protein is cleaved by furin-like proteases at the S20 site during viral egress.

The presence of this furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 suggests its cleavage by furin during viral egress. Similarly, MERS-CoV has an S20 site (RXXR#SA) that is less efficiently cleaved by furin and most probably cleaved by TMPRSS2 or cathepsin L during viral entry.

Subunit vaccine is safe and easily manufactured by recombinant DNA techniques but requires adjuvant to enhance an immune response. These vaccines work by introducing a fragment of the virus into the body (in the case of COVID-19, the &#8220;spike&#8221; protein). The idea behind the subunit vaccine is that when the body recognizes the protein, it creates specialized immune cells that block the receptors and effectively shut the door to infection. But the challenge is getting the body to recognize the virus fragment as enough of a threat to create an effective immune response, and injecting the spike protein alone is not enough to do that. &#8220;On its own, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is unstable. It needs to be &#8216;locked&#8217; into shape to ensure that the vaccine is inducing the right immune response to the COVID-19 virus if someone is exposed,&#8221; Professor Young said!

As in vectored and subunit vaccines, DVs also use spike peptides to elicit high titers of neutralizing antibodies. DVs elicit both the cell-mediated and humoral immune system. DVs induce long-lasting immunity that defends against diseases effectively in the future. DVs are very stable and can be produced within weeks because they do not need culture or fermentation. Of all the vaccines developed for SARS-CoV-2, DVs undoubtedly involve the most novel approach, since no vaccine using this technology has yet been commercialized for humans although this vaccine approach has obtained promising results in tests on animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>&#8226;].
