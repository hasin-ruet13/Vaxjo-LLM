Although many factors have the potential to influence vaccine immunogenicity and therefore vaccine effectiveness, increasing evidence from clinical studies and animal models now suggests that the composition and function of the gut microbiota are crucial factors modulating immune responses to vaccination.

Vaccines have led to the eradication or near eradication of diseases such as smallpox and polio, reduce disease severity when infection does occur, and can prevent the development of certain cancers, such as cervical cancer, by targeting the causative infectious agent (human papilloma virus). Vaccination also reduces antibiotic usage and therefore antibiotic resistance. For example, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and oral rotavirus vaccines (ORVs) prevent an estimated 23.8&#160;million and 13.6 million episodes of antibiotic-treated illness, respectively, among children under 5 years of age in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In fact, vaccination programmes have been so successful that many people, especially those living in high-income countries (HICs) with low burdens of infectious disease, had become complacent to the threats posed by infectious disease. In 2020, the world was shaken from this complacency by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to rapidly develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is highly&#160;effective in populations across the globe. Furthermore, effective vaccines against many other serious infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis and HIV-1, are still urgently required.</p><p id="Par4">Vaccines mainly mediate protection by inducing B cells that produce antigen-specific antibodies, although T cells also contribute to the protection mediated by some vaccines, such as the Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis, and are crucial to ensuring the induction of high-affinity antibodies and immune memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For reasons that are poorly understood, both B cell and T cell responses to vaccination are highly variable between individuals. For example, antibody titres induced by the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine can vary ~100-fold between individuals, antibody responses to conjugated pneumococcal vaccines and the <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib)&#160;vaccine vary up to 40-fold, and cytokine recall responses vary up to 10 log-fold in BCG-vaccinated infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. As we discuss in more detail below, vaccine immunogenicity has frequently been reported to be impaired in individuals living in LMICs compared with those in HICs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Compared with healthy adults, vaccine immunogenicity is also much poorer in infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and in the elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These data suggest that specific host factors that vary between LMICs and HICs and at the extremes of life strongly influence the quality and durability of the immune response to vaccination and therefore vaccine effectiveness, although it should be noted that factors other than immunogenicity can also impact vaccine efficacy. Increasing evidence points to the gut microbiota&#160;&#8212; which is highly variable between individuals, over the course of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and between different populations around the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (Box&#160;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">1</xref>) &#8212; as a crucial factor modulating immune responses to vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Here, we assess the evidence from clinical cohort studies, interventional studies and animal models that suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in modulating vaccine immunogenicity. Data from animal models are strongly supportive of the crucial role of gut microbiota in regulating immune responses to vaccination; however, further work is needed to better define the role of the gut microbiota in modulating vaccine immunogenicity in different human populations.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Differences in the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiota between low-income and high-income countries correlate with differences in vaccine immunogenicity.</title><p>Highlighted are example studies that have compared vaccine immunogenicity in individuals from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs; red, orange and yellow) to those living in high-income countries (HICs; purple); see Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for further details. The data for oral vaccines having reduced immunogenicity in LMICs are particularly convincing but further work is required to confirm whether responses to parenteral vaccines are impaired in LMICs as many of the reports so far are based on post hoc analyses of independent cohorts. Intriguingly, reported differences in vaccine immunogenicity correlate with differences in the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiota between these populations. Classifications of income status are based on data from the World Bank, which within the broad category of LMICs, classifies countries as low income (red), lower-middle income (orange) and upper-middle income (yellow).

The gut microbiota of populations from industrialized countries tends to have a lower diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref></sup> and to be more heavily dominated by Bacteroidaceae. By comparison, populations living a traditional lifestyle (hunter&#8211;gatherer and traditional agriculturalist) across Africa, Asia and South America have an increased abundance of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic> in their gut microbiota. Additionally, more taxonomically uncharacterized species have also been found to be present in the microbiota of non-Westernized populations, and certain families of bacteria, such as the Spirochaetaceae and Succinivibrionaceae, have been found to be prevalent in the Hadza hunter&#8211;gatherer people of Tanzania and other similar populations but are rare or undetected in the gut microbiota from Westernized countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref></sup>. In fact, a recent analysis of &gt;9,000 adult metagenomes from 32 different countries identified &gt;200 species-level &#8216;genome bins&#8217; that were enriched among non-Westernized adult populations. The gut microbiota of children living in non-industrialized settings are also different to those from industrialized countries. For example, Enterobacteriaceae have been found to be significantly more abundant in children from the European Union than in those from a rural setting in Burkina Faso<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref></sup>. Many factors associated with urbanization also differentially affect birth delivery mode, nutrition and medication use, which in turn are known to differentially affect the gut microbiota of infants across urbanization gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref></sup>. It is not just the composition of the gut microbiota that differs between these populations. The microbiota in more traditional populations has a greater encoded functional capacity for the utilization of complex plant carbohydrates as well as many other metabolic functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref></sup>. These differences in the gut microbiota between populations seem to be predominantly driven by diet and environment rather than genetics, as the microbiota of immigrants from less-industrialized countries who migrate to the USA undergo rapid changes, including a loss of diversity and replacement of <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic> species with Bacteroidaceae, therefore becoming more similar to Westernized populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref></sup>.</p></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Suboptimal vaccine responses in LMICs</title><p id="Par6">For reasons that are incompletely understood, vaccine immunogenicity has frequently been reported to be impaired in individuals from LMICs compared with those living in HICs.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, neomycin and metronidazole) were administered to healthy young adults (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;11) before and after vaccination. Antibiotic treatment resulted in a 10,000-fold, although transient, reduction in gut bacterial load and a marked and long-lasting reduction in bacterial diversity. However, there was no significant impact on neutralizing or antigen-binding antibody responses induced by vaccination. To determine whether this was owing to pre-existing immunity, the experiment was repeated with individuals who had low baseline antibody titres against influenza virus. Interestingly, in these participants, antibiotic treatment markedly reduced H1N1-specific neutralization and IgG1 and IgA binding antibody titres. In addition, in both study groups, antibiotic treatment resulted in increased transcriptional signatures of inflammation, which were similarly increased in healthy elderly subjects immunized with seasonal influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and divergent metabolic trajectories.

It is therefore possible that the microbiota has a more marked effect on primary responses&#160;to vaccination than on secondary immune&#160;responses. Another limitation is that several of the studies so far have assessed the impact of antibiotics on vaccine responses in adults. In mice (see next section), it has been shown that antibiotic exposure in infancy but not in adulthood leads to impaired responses to five parenteral vaccines licenced for infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, which suggests that alterations to the microbiota in early life may have greater effects on responses to vaccination than alterations in adulthood. This in turn raises the question of what impact antibiotics could have on responses to primary vaccination in neonates and infants. An ongoing clinical study will assess antibody responses to routine infant immunizations in infants directly exposed to antibiotics in the neonatal period or indirectly to maternally administered antibiotics intrapartum in comparison to infants not exposed to antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Evidence from animal models</title><p id="Par18">Data from animal models provide convincing evidence that the gut microbiota plays an important role in modulating immune responses to vaccination.

These impaired responses could be rescued by <xref rid="Glos6" ref-type="list">faecal microbiota transplantation</xref> (FMT) from age-matched untreated mice. The potential for antibiotic-driven dysregulation of the microbiota to influence responses to vaccination has important implications given that, from 2000 to 2015, antibiotic consumption increased by 65% worldwide (from 21.1 billion to 34.8 billion defined daily doses), primarily driven by increased antibiotic usage in LMICs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

These data are consistent with the study discussed above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, which also indicated that the gut microbiota does not play an important role in regulating antibody responses to live or adjuvanted vaccines in adult mice. These data suggest that there is a potential &#8216;window of opportunity&#8217; in early life, during which the microbiota may have a more marked influence on immune responses to vaccination. This is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a similar &#8216;window&#8217; for the microbiota to imprint on the immune system in other contexts. For example, in mice, the intestinal microbiota induces a strong immune response at weaning&#160;that, if inhibited, can lead to a pathological imprinting that drives disease susceptibility in later life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Microbiota and lymphocyte responses</title><p id="Par19">Aside from studies that have directly investigated the role of the microbiota in responses to vaccination, several other studies have highlighted important roles for the gut microbiota in modulating B cell and T cell responses that likely have important implications for the effects of the microbiota on vaccine immunogenicity.

Blooms of specific pathobionts, such as members of the LPS-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which frequently overgrow when the gut is inflamed or following antibiotic exposure, may lead to increased levels of LPS in the gut and in the periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, thereby influencing responses to vaccines that are administered concurrently with these blooms. The ability of the microbiota to influence the responses to parenteral vaccines is also likely dependent on gut barrier integrity. When the gut epithelial barrier is compromised, for example owing to gut inflammation, malnutrition or antibiotic exposure, increased levels of antigens and immunomodulatory products produced by the gut microbiota are readily detected in the periphery, where they can modulate systemic immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Furthermore, metabolites produced by specific taxa in the gut microbiota can support gut barrier integrity by upregulating epithelial tight junction proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, which suggests that the abundance of specific taxa in the gut microbiota may alter the degree of gut &#8216;leakiness&#8217; and therefore the amount of microbiota-produced natural adjuvants in the periphery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Microbiota-mediated reprogramming of antigen-presenting cells</title><p id="Par25">Antigen-presenting cells, such as DCs, play a crucial role in presenting vaccine antigens to T cells and controlling the magnitude, quality and durability of the ensuing immune response. PRRs control the key functions of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and increasing data indicate that the microbiota can potently modulate DC function, suggesting a potential way in which the microbiota could act as a natural adjuvant to vaccination (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). After intranasal immunization with inactive cholera toxin, TLR-mediated sensing of the microbiota by lung DCs led to the upregulation of the gut-homing receptors &#945;4&#946;7 integrin and CC-chemokine receptor 9 on IgA<sup>+</sup> B cells. The migration of these cells from the lung to the gut resulted in protection against oral challenge with cholera toxin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. In germ-free mice receiving intranasal immunization with inactive cholera toxin, the levels of antigen-specific IgA in the gut were significantly reduced. Furthermore, depletion of the microbiota by broad-spectrum antibiotics has been shown to inhibit the TLR-dependent production of total IgA in the lungs of mice and humans in intensive care units, contributing to increased susceptibility to <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Recently, the microbiota has also been shown to regulate the constitutive production of type I interferon by plasmacytoid DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Type I interferon production by plasmacytoid DCs induces a specific epigenomic and metabolic state in conventional DCs such that they more efficiently prime antigen-specific T cell responses. The microbiota may also have an adjuvant effect on vaccine responses through effects on other antigen-presenting cells. For example, DCs were found to be dispensable for the ability of microbiota-produced flagellin to enhance&#160;the antibody responses to the non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Instead, these effects were dependent on macrophages, as macrophage-depleted mice failed to mount a detectable antibody response to the vaccine at 7 days after immunization. The microbiota has also been shown to modulate antigen presentation by intestinal epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, which could have implications for immune responses to oral vaccines and, as discussed in more detail below, the microbiota can also exert direct effects on B cells and T cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Immunomodulation by microbiota-derived metabolites</title><p id="Par27">In addition to molecules sensed by PRRs, the gut microbiota also produces a large number of metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> that have the potential to modulate immune responses (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Amongst the best studied of these are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate and propionate, which are the main metabolic end products of bacterial fermentation in the colon. SCFAs have been shown to increase oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis in B cells to support the energy demands of optimal homeostatic (non-pathogen-specific) antibody responses and antibody responses to <italic toggle="yes">Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. This study also showed that SCFAs enhanced the expression of genes involved in plasma cell differentiation and class switching. However, a more recent study reported that SCFAs inhibit rather than enhance antibody responses to intragastrically administered ovalbumin as well as inhibiting autoantibody responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Given these conflicting reports, further work is needed to assess the impact of SCFAs on antibody responses to oral and parenteral vaccines.</p><p id="Par28">Aside from SCFAs, the immunomodulatory properties of many other microbiota-derived metabolites, including secondary bile acids and tryptophan metabolites, are increasingly being uncovered. For example, antibiotic treatment has been shown to significantly reduce levels of secondary bile acids, the reduction of which correlated with enhanced inflammatory signatures in humans immunized with the influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. As mentioned earlier, microbiota-derived metabolites may also indirectly regulate immune responses to vaccination by enhancing gut barrier integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>, thus potentially reducing the escape of microbial molecules that enhance parenteral vaccine responses. Further work is also needed to assess the immunomodulatory effects of these metabolites on other immune cell populations that regulate responses to vaccination such as T cells and DCs. SCFAs have potent effects on T cells in other contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> but whether SCFAs can regulate vaccine-induced T cell-mediated immunity remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Microbiota-encoded cross-reactive antigens</title><p id="Par29">Previous studies in humans have identified CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells specific for pathogen-encoded antigens in individuals who were not previously infected with those pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. A potential explanation is T cell receptor (TCR) cross-reactivity to environmental antigens, particularly antigens and epitopes encoded by the gut microbiota (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Circulating and tissue-resident CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with reactivity to the intestinal microbiota are abundant in healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup> and bioinformatic predictions suggest that there is extensive sharing of the TCR epitope repertoire between the human proteome, the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> and therefore, presumably, with vaccine-encoded pathogen antigens. Increasing data suggest that the presence of these cross-reactive T cells (and, in some cases, cross-reactive B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>) can modulate immune responses to pathogens by either dampening or enhancing the immunogenicity of pathogen-associated antigenic epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. The presence of cross-reactive T cells at baseline has also been shown to positively correlate with immune responses to the influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. The origin of the cross-reactive T cells was not identified in these studies but other studies have identified T cells that cross-react with both influenza virus-derived peptides and epitopes encoded by taxa in the microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Recently, cross-reactivity between MHC class I-restricted tumour antigens and epitopes of a bacteriophage protein encoded in the genome of <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus hirae</italic> has been reported. Mice colonized with <italic toggle="yes">E. hirae</italic> harbouring this bacteriophage had improved responses to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Whether epitopes encoded by the gut microbiota stimulate B cells or T cells that cross-react with vaccine antigens and alter responses to immunization is currently unknown but this potential mechanism by which the gut microbiota could influence vaccine responses is worthy of further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Targeting the microbiota</title><p id="Par30">Microbiota-targeted interventions, including prebiotics, probiotics, <xref rid="Glos9" ref-type="list">synbiotics</xref>, FMT and small-molecule drugs that inhibit specific microbial processes, are being extensively investigated in many contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. Whereas some of these, such as FMT, are unlikely to be feasible at a population scale or are at very early stages of development, such as microbiota-targeted drugs, others such as probiotics (with or without prebiotics or other dietary interventions) are potentially more attractive interventions to improve vaccine efficacy owing to their safety, cost effectiveness and scalability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. Probiotics are already proving to be effective interventions to prevent diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis, acute diarrhoea and sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a recent preclinical study has shown that synbiotics can enhance responses to the oral cholera vaccine in mice colonized with the microbiota of non-responder infants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">A recent systematic review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup> reported that only ~50% of the 26 RCTs carried out so far have found a beneficial effect of probiotics on vaccine responses (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). However, these trials had several limitations, including small sample sizes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;&lt;50 per group in many studies). Furthermore, differences in the probiotic strains investigated, including their purity and viability, and the timing, duration and dose of administration make these studies difficult to compare directly. Perhaps more importantly, none of these trials specifically recruited participants with a disrupted microbiota (for example, those exposed to antibiotics). Twelve of the 26 RCTs did not report whether or not participants were exposed to antibiotics; 9 specifically excluded these participants and, in those studies that included antibiotic-exposed participants, the sample size was very small. It is highly unlikely that administering probiotics to already well-colonized, healthy infants would have a significant effect on the immune response to vaccination. Well-powered RCTs that assess the beneficial effects of microbiota-targeted interventions in infants with a disrupted microbiota are therefore warranted.</p><p id="Par32">Trials investigating the impact of microbiota-targeted interventions, such as prebiotics and probiotics, on vaccine responses in the elderly have mostly examined responses to the influenza vaccine. These studies found little to no improvement in vaccine responses in elderly individuals supplemented with probiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>; however, the number of participants was small and these studies mostly used probiotics containing <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> strains, which are not commonly found in the adult gut. Further research is needed to identify adult-adapted strains of probiotics that might be more beneficial as interventions in the elderly. Some studies have suggested that probiotics can unexpectedly delay the re-establishment of a diverse microbiota following antibiotic exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>, although normal recolonization may not be required for a beneficial effect. For example, administering <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic>-based probiotics to antibiotic-treated mice prevented colonization by pathobionts and suppressed inflammation without fully restoring a diverse gut microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Given the potential effects of gut barrier integrity and of the translocation of microbial products on responses to vaccination, microbiota-targeted interventions may not need to fully restore the gut microbiota to a &#8216;healthy&#8217; state to be of benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions and perspectives</title><p id="Par33">The studies discussed above provide strong support for the idea that the gut microbiota modulates both B cell and T cell responses to vaccination, although much further work is required. A growing number of observational studies in infants have identified associations between specific bacterial phyla and families in the gut microbiota and immune responses to vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>; however, causal links remain to be proven. The identification of the exact species or strains of bacteria that mediate these effects is crucial to demonstrating these causal links and to elucidating the mechanisms involved. Cohort studies so far have been limited in this regard as they have used 16S rRNA sequencing, which lacks species-specific and strain-specific resolution, rather than shotgun metagenomics. Furthermore, interventional studies, for example, assessing the impact of probiotics or antibiotics on vaccine responses, have so far been significantly underpowered and have provided evidence for only relatively modest effects of the microbiota on vaccine responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>, although they do suggest a greater impact on antibody responses in humans with low levels of pre-existing immunity and major effects on the metabolome and innate immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>. Larger, better-powered trials are now needed to expand on these data, particularly trials that assess interventions targeted to the appropriate populations such as infants living in LMICs.</p><p id="Par34">As mentioned above, a broad range of other factors have been suggested to alter vaccine immunogenicity and/or efficacy (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), including intrinsic host factors (age, sex and genetics), nutritional factors (diet, body mass index, micronutrients and enteropathy), perinatal factors (breastfeeding, gestational age and intrapartum antibiotics), environmental factors (geographical location, rural versus urban location, family size and season) and other infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Most of these factors have also been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota and baseline immunity. Deconvoluting these highly complex interdependent relationships in human cohort studies is exceptionally challenging. These complexities necessitate studies that use multi-omic systems vaccinology approaches with appropriate statistical controls for potential confounding factors, similar to those applied recently to investigate the links between the gut microbiota and responses to the influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">Another approach to untangle these interdependent relationships is the use of well-designed preclinical studies, which can control for these factors by tightly regulating the environment and diet, by age-matching and sex-matching, and using littermates. One approach that we are using to establish causal relationships between specific bacterial taxa and vaccine responses is to monocolonize germ-free mice with specific strains of bacteria from the microbiota that have been associated with altered vaccine responses in human cohorts and then assess the immune responses to the same vaccines in these mice. A similar approach has been previously used to identify immunomodulatory taxa in the gut microbiota in other contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>. These experiments may identify novel probiotic strains that have a disproportionately beneficial impact on vaccine responses and could also be used to screen for more personalized probiotics depending on an individual&#8217;s microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. This is important, as one cannot assume that a probiotic that is beneficial in infants in HICs will have the same effect in infants in LMICs, where the composition of the microbiota is likely to be substantially different (Box&#160;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). Vaccine responses are also frequently suboptimal in other vulnerable groups such as the elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> or those with obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>. Both ageing and obesity are associated with a dysregulation of the gut microbiota. Given that elderly individuals and individuals with obesity are at higher risk from COVID-19, interventions that can boost vaccine effectiveness (including SARS-CoV-2 vaccines) in these populations, even modestly, may be highly desirable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par36">We have outlined several potential immunological mechanisms by which the microbiota could influence immune responses to vaccination. However, given the sometimes contradictory data in different studies, most of the proposed mechanisms remain as plausible hypotheses rather than established facts. Further work is now needed to more fully elucidate these mechanisms in different contexts. These efforts may be complicated by redundancies between different pathways and potential dependencies between the relative importance of certain mechanisms and the composition of the gut microbiota in specific individuals or populations. A better understanding of how the microbiota regulates vaccine responses in different populations and in different contexts may also inform the use of more tailored population-specific adjuvants to enhance responses to vaccination. Much of the research in this field has so far focused on the gut microbiota and mainly its bacterial component. The microbiota at other sites may also play crucial roles depending on the route of vaccination. For example, NOD2-mediated sensing of the microbiota is required for optimal responses to intranasal immunization with a model antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the composition of the nasal microbiota has been associated with IgA responses to a live attenuated influenza vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref></sup>. The skin microbiota could also influence immune responses to intradermal vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref></sup>, which may be increasingly important given the interest in using microneedle arrays for vaccine delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref></sup>. Further work is also needed to investigate the potential of the mycobiome and virome to modulate vaccine responses given our increasing understanding of their contributions to modulating immune responses in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref></sup>. For example, recent work has suggested that enteric viruses have a greater impact than the bacterial microbiota on responses to OPV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Finally, it is increasingly recognized that vaccines not only induce specific immunity but can also have potent non-specific effects on immune responses to unrelated infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref></sup>. Whether or not the gut microbiota can influence the non-specific effects of vaccines is, to our knowledge, almost completely unexplored. Given the increasing appreciation of the potential importance of these effects, investigations in this area should be prioritized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
