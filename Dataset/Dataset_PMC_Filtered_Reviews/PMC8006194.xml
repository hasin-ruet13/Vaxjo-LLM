Many countries are facing a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A pressing need is evident for the development of a potent vaccine to control the SARS-CoV-2. Institutions and companies in many countries have announced their vaccine research programs and progress against the COVID-19. While most vaccines go through the designation and preparation stages, some of them are under evaluation for efficacy among animal models and clinical trials, and three approved vaccine candidates have been introduced for limited exploitation in Russia and China. An effective vaccine must induce a protective response of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity and should meet the safety and efficacy criteria. Although the emergence of new technologies has accelerated the development of vaccines, there are several challenges on the way, such as limited knowledge about the pathophysiology of the virus, inducing humoral or cellular immunity, immune enhancement with animal coronavirus vaccines, and lack of an appropriate animal model. In this review, we firstly discuss the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 disease, subsequently, give an overview of several vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-2 under clinical trials and challenges in vaccine development against this virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Therapy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">New severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.The reproductive number (R0) estimated for SARS-CoV-2 is 2.2, which means one infected person can cause viral transmission to 2.2 other persons, thus this infection is highly transmissible with estimated 5.8-day incubation period <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Coronaviruses include four classes of alpha (&#945;), beta (&#946;), gamma (&#947;) and delta (&#948;) strains. The SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are in beta coronavirus class. The SARS-CoV-2genome is completely sequenced and represented similarity to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">The SARS-CoV-2, like other members of Coronaviradae family, consists of an envelope surrounding a single-stranded 30-kb RNA including 14 open reading frames (ORF). Four major proteins can be found in this virus, including, nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and spike (S). The N fragment comprises T-cell epitopes <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The S fragment is the predominant target to synthesize the vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, mainly because of triggering the antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus as the immune response to vaccination. The N-terminal domain of S protein sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 consists of three excess short insertions when comparing with the SARS-CoV. Moreover, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S fragment contains alterations in 4 out of 5 main residues <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on the cell membrane of the host, acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The binding interaction between ACE2 and viral S protein is a central phase for triggering infection process. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is lower respiratory tracts, leading to pneumonia. In addition, this virus may bind to its receptor on the central nervous system (CNS), liver, kidney, gastrointestinal system and heart, resulting in multiple organ failure (MOF) <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">Moreover, several nonstructural proteins are encoded by the viral genome such as PLpro (papain-like protease), RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and coronavirus main protease (3CLpro). The virus after entering to the host cell releases the genome as a +ssRNA, which is then translated to the proteins of the virus via utilizing the translation machinery of host cell. Subsequently, viral proteins are cleaved by PLpro and 3CLpro to form effector proteins. In addition, PLpro is a deubiquitinase capable of deubiquinating specific proteins in the host cell, such as NF-&#954;B and interferon factor 3, leading to suppression of host immune system.</p><p id="p0045">A full-length template of minus-strand RNA of the virus is synthesized using the RdRp for the replication of more viral genome <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Coronaviruses represent a high recombination rate because the replication of viral genome by RdRp result in increased rate of mutation thus, increasing the rate of homologous recombination. With respect to their high mutation rate coronaviruses are zoonotic pathogens that are capable of infecting humans and animals and result in extensive clinical symptoms, from asymptomatic features to severe symptoms result in the failure of many organs in the body <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although, there is a need for months and probably years for knowing the complete characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and its probable sources, symptoms, and host immune responses in the battle against infection. Studies are ongoing to produce the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccines at high speed and large scale, mostly including DNA-based, mRNA-based, viral vectored, subunit and inactivated vaccines, as well as mainly based on S protein. However, in the way of producing a new vaccine there are so many challenges including poor success in developing human SARS/MERS vaccines, lack of appropriate animal models, limited knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, and targeting mucosal or humoral immunity <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The Ministry of Health of Russian Federation, on 11 August 2020, approved the vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) produced by the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow. Scientists have raised great concern about the safety and efficacy of this vaccine because has not yet entered Phase 3 clinical trials. It should be noted that 234 vaccine candidates were being developed as of September 2020, 38 of which in clinical trials and 33 of these in Phase I-II trials and 6 in Phase II-III trials (11).</p><p id="p0050">The current review aimed to briefly overview the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, various vaccine candidates (mainly in clinical trials) and the challenges of implementing vaccine strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Host immune responses to COVID-19</title><p id="p0055">At present the information about the host immune response to COVID-19 is very limited. According to the cumulative empirical and clinical evidence on the study coronaviruses, it is possible to predict the mechanism of host immune system to combat this virus and the viral strategy to induce these immune responses <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p id="p0060">Numerous studies illustrate important changes in the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Clinically, the COVID-19 infection mediated immune responses are in two stages. There is a need for specific response of adaptive immunity within the incubation period and non-severe phases to remove the virus and inhibit the disease progression to severe phases. Thus, the pathways to improve immune responses (pegylated or anti-sera IFN&#945;) are course essential during this period <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although, the first protective line to control the viral infection is a fast and well-coordinated immune response, strong inflammation of innate immunity and dysregulated protection of host adaptive immunity can develop tissue damages either at the virus entry site or at whole body. In this regard, the excessive cytokine and chemokine release, named as &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221;, is defined as uncontrolled dysregulation of immune defense in the host. Therefore, due to the main function of immune responses in SARA-CoV-2, knowing the process underlying immune dysregulation as well as the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 to escape from immune response help us to clinically manage the acute conditions and prevent the mild-to-severe stage transition <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. An endogenous protective immune response can be established at the non-severe and incubation stages if the host has a suitable genetic history (e.g. HLA) and good general health eliciting a special antiviral immune response. The differences in genetic history in terms of the immune reactions against the pathogens can establish the individual alterations. However, in the impaired protective immunity, the viruses spread and the tissue is destroyed massively, particularly in organs with greater expression level of ACE2, including kidneys and intestines. Innate lung inflammation occurs in the damaged cells, predominantly due to proinflammatory granulocytes and macrophages. Therefore, during the severe stages in COVID-19 patients, the absolute number of natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and CD4 <sup>+</sup> and CD8 <sup>+</sup> cells is significantly reduced in the circulation <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and also a reduction in basophils, eosinophils and monocytes has been reported <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. furthermore, most of severe COVID-19 patients showed substantially increase in proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF&#945;, CCL3, IP-10, MCP-1, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-17, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1&#946; and IL-2) in the serum <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The inflammation of lungs is the major reason for the deadly respiratory diseases <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Suitable status of general health may therefore not be beneficial for the cases progressed to severe degree. If the lung damage develops significantly, the examinations should be directed to inhibit the inflammatory reaction and control the illness signs.</p><p id="p0065">Alarmingly, some patients remain/return positive for the SARS-CoV-2 and others even relapse after discharge from hospital. This means that it may be difficult to trigger a SARS-CoV-2 virus-eliminating immune response probably in several cases, and these patients may not response to the vaccines. The survivors from non-severe condition must be checked for the presence of virus and the responses of B/T cells, especially when determining vaccine production strategies. Additionally, several coronavirus types or subtypes have been introduced. Therefore, if the vaccines that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 are found to face problems for production, the Edward Jenner approach should be considered <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p id="p0070">A new infection of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in children in a recent study, associated with a remarkable inflammatory response. This condition has been known as pediatric inflammatory, multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS). The new syndrome was temporally associated with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2. PIMS-TS is an acute presentation of the virus in children and needs to be detected early to prevent its development and probable adverse impacts <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The primary signs of PIMS-TS are fever, inflammation marks (rash, oral mucosal changes, and conjunctivitis), cardiac dysfunction, and gastrointestinal symptoms. These characteristics are associated with laboratory evidence of remarkable inflammation: lymphopenia, neutrophilia, higher ferritin concentrations, and serum CRP; non-ST elevation pancarditis, and hypercoagulable state. Besides, echocardiograms usually show hyperechoic coronary arteries and left ventricular dysfunction <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. PIMS-TS complications are systemic thrombosis and coronary artery aneurysms in nearly 13% of children in some published cohorts <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Approximately 2% of these children have died <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Retarded clearance of the SARS-CoV-2, which resulted in unchecked inflammation, is a potential mechanism for PIMS-TS <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Serum concentrations of proinflammatory interleukins (IL-1 beta, IL-17, IL-6, and IL-8) were very high in children with PIMS-TS. It was accompanied by monocytes and neutrophils activation <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, in viral clearance, there is a handful of data on the anti-viral interferons' function (alpha, beta, and lambda). It also has been suggested that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), with the host cells&#8217; invasion amplified by serum proteases, antibody, or auto-antibody induced disease <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p id="p0075">Nevertheless, PIMS-TS seem to affect only young adults and children, and ADE would be anticipated in older adults (with higher prevalence before exposure to other coronaviruses). The adult patient&#8217;s treatment with COVID-19 recovering plasma has also not been correlated with hyperinflammation. The extensive effects of intravenous immunoglobulins via Fc&#947;-receptors, diminishing lymphocyte apoptosis, scavenging of inflammatory mediators, and preventing hypothesizing for the PIMS-TS&#8217; pathobiology <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Innate immunity to infection with SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="p0080">Today, limited data are available on the host innate immune responses in the patients with SARS-CoV-2. In a study on the cases (n&#160;=&#160;99) examined in Wuhan, total neutrophils were elevated (38%), total lymphocytes were decreased (35%), the IL-6 level was increased in serum (52%) and c-reactive protein was increased (84%) <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Reduced lymphocytes and increased neutrophils correlate also with the seriousness of disease and death <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, the ICU patients had greater serum levels of innate cytokines such as, TNF&#945;, MIP-1A, MCP-1, and IP-10 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These clinical characteristics proposed a potential role of hyperinflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Efficient innate immunity against the viral infectious diseases is highly dependent on the IFN I (interferon type I) responses and their downstream cascade which eventually results in the control of viral replication and the provocation of strong adaptive immunity. The SARS-CoV has been reported to directly infect T cells and macrophages, a key feature in pathogenesis mediated by SARS-CoV, which induces delayed but increased proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. The ACE2 is a receptor minimally expressed in T cells, monocytes and macrophages in the lungs. However the strategy of SARS-CoV2 for directly infect any immune cells is still unknown <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A suitable antiviral response can be created by recognizing the invasion of viruses via innate immune cells, mostly through the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, PAMP. It is known for RNA viruses, including coronavirus, that PAMPs as viral genomic RNA or dsRNA (an intermediate produced within the viral replication), are identified by cytosolic RNA sensor, TLR7 and TLR3 as well as the endosomal RNA receptors, MDA5/RIG-I. Such identification process activates the downstream signaling pathway, such as IRF3 and NF-&#954;B transcription factors, with the nuclear translocation. Such nuclear factors trigger the expression of IFN I and some proinflammatory cytokines. These primary reactions constitute the first protective line to control the viral infection at the penetration site <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In turn, the IFN-I uses the IFNAR to activate the JAK-STAT pathway in which the STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated by JAK1 and TYK2 kinases. After form complex of STAT/2 with IRF9, they underwent nuclear shift for starting the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) transcription supervised by promoters-containing IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p id="p0085">According to the collected data from previous coronavirus infections, the innate immunity is important in protective or destructive reactions, opening a gate for the intervention immune. Later on, active viral replication leads to the overproduction of IFN I and the release of macrophages and neutrophils as the key resources of proinflammatory cytokine. During COVID19, the SARS-CoV-2 is capable of provoking delayed IFN I and viral control loss in an early infection with related alterations in overall lymphocytes and neutrophils <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Several approaches may be suggested about the key role of innate immunity, including some antagonists of key antiviral agents and proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN I. In the use of IFN I as the treatment, timing of administration in a murine models of SARS-CoV infection is crucial to providing protective response <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Adaptive immunity to infection with SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="p0090">In general, T helper type 1 (Th1) immune response plays is important for the adaptive immune response to the viral infections. The microenvironment of cytokine formed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) directs the T cell responses. While cytotoxic T cells are necessary to kill the cells infected with virus, the Th cells organize the adaptive immunity. Humoral immunity, especially the neutralizing antibody formation, provides excellent protection through the restriction of later-phase infection and inhibits the possible recurrent infection. The epitopes of both T and B cell in SARS-CoV for the structural proteins (E, N, S and M proteins) were extensively mapped <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Activated Th1/Th17 cells may exacerbate the inflammation. Plasma/B cells develop specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, which may help to neutralize viruses. Long lasting specific IgGs and neutralizing antibodies are recorded for approximately two years after infection <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><sec id="s0025"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Cellular immune responses</title><p id="p0095">As regards adaptive immunity, the novel SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the counting and balance of lymphocytes. The T cell response was extensively investigated in SARS-CoV. In a cohort study in Wuhan involving 452 patients with COVID-19, the patients with severe COVID-19 reported a smaller count of total T cells (suppressor and helper T cells) <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Reduced regulatory T cells was observed among Th cells, with highly decrease depending on the illness intensity of patients, and in memory T cells, while the percent of na&#239;ve T cells was elevated <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In another study using 128 convalescent samples, CD8-positive T cell responses were prevalent higher than CD4- positive T cell reactions. In addition, specific viral T cells from the patients with severe condition appeared to be a main memory phenotype having a markedly greater number of polyfunctional CD4- positive T cells (TNF&#945;, IFN&#947;, and IL-2) and CD8- positive T cells (TNF&#945;, IFN&#947;, and degranulated state) when comparing with the mild-moderate patients. Potent T-cell responses significantly associated with greater neutralizing antibodies whereas higher Th2 cytokines (IL4, IL5, IL10) in the serum were identified in the fatal patients group <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Memory and na&#239;ve T cells are necessary for the immune system, whose equilibrium plays a pivotal role to maintain an effective defensive system. The na&#239;ve T cells activate a large and closely coordinated release of cytokines to defend against new and previously unrecognized infections, while memory T cells induce the antigen-specific immunity. Dysregulated balance in favor of na&#239;ve T cell over regulatory T cells may significantly develop the hyperinflammation <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p id="p0100">A majority of responses (70%) induced versus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, spike, shell and membrane) was found for epitope mapping. Reportedly, the Th1 responses can effectively control the SARSCoV and MERSCoV, and probably the SARS-CoV-2. However, the critical CD8-positive T cell response must be regulated in order to prevent lung pathology. Because a majority of epitopes for both MERSCoV and SARSCoV are concentrated on the structural proteins of the virus, it is useful to map those epitopes of MERSCoV/SARSCoV with the epitopes of SARSCoV-2.

They utilized the LNPs for packaging the mRNAs and evaluated the immunogenicity for all mRNA LNP vaccines in the BALB/c mice.

Moreover, these VLPs package bacterial RNA during the synthesis process that acts as potent adjuvants as a ligand for TLR 7/8.

That was assigned to the appearance of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) in South Africa and 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) in the UK <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. In South Africa, high transmission and high herd immunity may have supported the appearance and the following spread of the variant. Both variants showed a mutation (N501Y) on the spike protein&#8217;s receptor-binding domain that is suggested to participate in higher transmission <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. It is estimated that the transmission rate is between 40 and 70% <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Furthermore, the 501Y.V2 variant shows two additional mutations (K417N and E484K) in the spike protein that allow a possible immune escape from antibodies <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Additionally, another set of mutations (N501Y, K417T, and E484K) in a new P.1 (501Y.V3) lineage has been characterized in Manaus, Brazil <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. Also, L452R is another mutation that was observed to be increased. It was recently associated with a significant breakout in California, but health professionals stated that it&#8217;s not clear if it caused more infections <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. A critical issue is whether COVID-19 vaccines can protect against these new SARS-CoV-2 variants or not. Initial research demonstrated that individuals sera who immunized with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could neutralize a 501 mutation pseudo-virion, whereas it neutralizes a 501-484-417 mutant pseudo-virion to lower levels <xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Collier et al. evaluated immune responses after vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22 <xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. They quantified neutralizing antibody responses after first and second immunizations with the eight amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein or pseudo-viruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein. They reported that the vaccine sera displayed a wide range of neutralizing titers in the case of wild-type pseudo-viruses that were quietly reduced against the B.1.1.7 variant. This decline was also observed in sera from some recovering patients. Lowered B.1.1.7 neutralization was also reported with monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBM (5 out of 31), N-terminal domain (9 out of 10). But is not observed in RBD neutralizing mAbs binding outside the RBM. Presentation of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background to consider a newly appeared Variant of Concern (VOC 202102/02) resulted in a more remarkable loss of neutralizing function by vaccine-induced antibodies and mAbs (19 out of 31) over that obtained by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone. E484K appearance on a B.1.1.7 background provides a threat to the vaccine BNT162b <xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Wang et al., in another study, observed that B.1.1.7 is resistant to neutralization by most mAbs to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike <xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. It is also quite resistant to a few mAbs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, it is not more resistant to recovered persons plasma or vaccine sera. Findings on B.1.351 are more worrying because this variant is not only resistant to neutralization by most NTD mAbs but also multiple individual mAbs to the receptor-binding motif on RBD, mainly because of an E484K mutation. Furthermore, B.1.351 is significantly more refractory to neutralization through vaccine sera (10.3&#8211;12.4-fold) and convalescent plasma (9.4-fold). Emergent variants13,14 and B.1.351 with identical spike mutations show new mAb therapy problems and warn of current vaccines' protective efficacy <xref rid="b0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Besides, initial clinical trial findings of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 suggested 74% efficacy in the UK3 but only 22% in South Africa. In contrast, NVX-CoV2373, a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated 89% efficacy in the UK, but in South Africa, where the 501Y.V2 variant predominates, the effectiveness was only 49% <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, <xref rid="b0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Similarly, efficacy differences in South Africa and the USA (57% vs. 72%) were observed for the Ad26COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Promisingly, in South Africa, 85% protection against COVID-19 for the Ad26COV2.S vaccine has been shown. However, we are not sure about the precision estimated value released by the press <xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>.

The higher viral transmission provides a greater chance for occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants. Therefore, ending the pandemic disease is only possible when effective vaccines against new variants are administered across the world fairly. While high-income countries compete to vaccinate their people within months, they leave themselves unprotected to new variants of SARS-CoV-2 evolving in lower-income countries that vaccines could not protect them <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>.

This finding suggests the similar early dynamics of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and other acute viral infections. In 2021, Crawford et al. <xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref> evaluated both the binding and neutralizing antibody levels in serial samples of plasma from 32 SARS-CoV-2&#8211;infected persons with a range of disease severity follow-up as long as 152&#160;days after symptom initiation. They reported that, on average, neutralizing titers declined about four folds from approximately 30 to more than 90&#160;days after symptom beginning. This reduction in neutralizing titers was accompanied with a decline in antibodies level that attaches to the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, most convalesced individuals still had significant neutralizing titers at 3&#8211;4&#160;months after symptom start <xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref>. In another study, lyer, and colleagues in 2020 quantified plasma and/or serum antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 &#8216;S protein in 343 North American people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (of which 93% were hospitalized) up to 122&#160;days following symptom initiation <xref rid="b0560" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>. Next, they compared the results with responses of 1548 individuals whose blood samples were taken before the pandemic. This investigation's findings were also added to rising evidence on the perseveration and decay of antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgA and IgM responses to RBD were short-lived, and most patients seroreverted within 2.5&#160;months following the beginning of the illness. However, IgG antibodies were preserved at detectable levels in individuals more than 90&#160;days after symptom start, and seroreversion was only reported in a small part of patients. These anti-RBD IgG antibodies&#8217; concentration was also highly associated with pseudo-virus NAb titers, which also showed minimal decay. Observing the persistence of IgG and neutralizing antibody responses is promising and displays the robust systemic immune memory development in patients with acute infection. These results were identical to those observed in a study on anti-RBD antibodies in 121 North American convalescent plasma donors up to 82&#160;days from symptom onset <xref rid="b0565" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref> and a research work of 1,197 Icelanders who stayed seropositive by two pan-IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays 120&#160;days following the qPCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (9).

They reported that IgM and IgG titers against the RBD of S protein declined remarkably over this period, with IgA being less influenced. At the same time, neutralizing function in plasma was reduced by five-times in pseudotype virus assays. In contrast, the RBD-specific memory B cells&#8217; number stayed unchanged at 6.2&#160;months following the infection. Memory B cells showed clonal turnover after 6.2&#160;months, and their antibodies demonstrated raised potency, more somatic hypermutation, and refractory to RBD mutations, suggested the continued evolution of the humoral response. PCR and immunofluorescence analyses of intestinal biopsies took from asymptomatic patients at four months after the COVID-19 onset showed the perseverance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small intestine of 7 out of 14 individuals.

Current challenges raise some concerns that vaccination may not lead to a long-term and effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. These concerns are the existence of more than 80 genotypical variants of the SARS-CoV-2, the likelihood of reinfection, and the short-lived seropositivity for neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, Ig levels may not be associated with the risk of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and viral shedding <xref rid="b0590" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. Also, the short-lasting immunity against the virus may prevent the improved homogeneity of affected individuals in a certain time frame. Thus, population immunity may not be obtained; because reinfection may happen even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. These challenges led to the concern that abolishing the COVID-19 pandemic may not be as practical as assumed.

Nanoparticles derived from viruses are mainly attractive to novel vaccine formulations, producing strong biodegradable protein nanocapsules generated from the pathogen-specific antigen. The preparation of hydrophilic nanocontainers through water-in-oil mini-emulsions and then delivery to an aqueous solution is greatly important, as it allows hydrophilic payloads to be encapsulated efficiently in large quantities. The NS5A protein was used to produce the vaccine candidates for the hepatitis C virus.

The CD4 Th cell epitope inclusion induces a potent antibody reaction to the B cell antigen target. Also, the immunity on the T cell epitope is reduced via fully spatial separation of the two antigens through the liposomal bilayer, reducing the immunity on the T cell epitope. The liposomal capacity for carrying cargoes enables immunostimulatory molecules to be simultaneously transferred to the target immune cells, including cytokines or TLR agonists, thus minimizing the systemic sensitivity to such adjuvants.
