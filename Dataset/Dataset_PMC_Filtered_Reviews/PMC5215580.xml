Oral PrEP is now FDA approved for HIV-prevention in high risk groups, but partial adherence reduces efficacy. If combined as biomedical preventions (CBP) an HIV vaccine could provide protection when PrEP adherence is low and PrEP could prevent vaccine breakthroughs. Other types of PrEP or microbicides may also be partially protective. When licensed, first generation HIV vaccines are likely to be partially effective. Individuals at risk for HIV may receive an HIV vaccine combined with other biomedical preventions, in series or in parallel, in clinical trials or as part of standard of care, with the goal of maximally increasing HIV prevention. In human studies, it is challenging to determine which preventions are best combined, how they interact and how effective they are.</p><p>Animal models can determine CBP efficacy, whether additive or synergistic, the efficacy of different products and combinations, dose, timing and mechanisms. CBP studies in macaques have shown that partially or minimally effective candidate HIV vaccines combined with partially effective oral PrEP, vaginal PrEP or microbicide generally provided greater protection than either prevention alone against SIV or SHIV challenges. Since human CBP trials will be complex, animal models can guide their design, sample size, endpoints, correlates and surrogates of protection. This review focuses on animal studies and human models of CBP and discusses implications for HIV prevention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>clinical trials</kwd><kwd>HIV prevention</kwd><kwd>HIV vaccine</kwd><kwd>macaque</kwd><kwd>PrEP</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0001"><title>Global HIV epidemic and the prevention tool box</title><p>Since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, almost 80&#160;million people have become infected with HIV<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>, predominantly through heterosexual intercourse.

</p><p>Cheng-Mayer et&#160;al. reported the first NHP study of CBP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table&#160;1</xref>).<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> A DNA prime recombinant adenovirus boost T cell-based vaccine was administered to rhesus macaques followed by a vaginal microbicide gel with a suboptimal concentration of an HIV-1 nucleocapsid zinc finger inhibitor. Animals received 20 repeated vaginal challenges with escalating doses of SHIV<sub>162P3</sub>. Three of 15 animals in the CBP group compared to 2 of 8 in the vaccine group were protected indicating no increased protection by combining gel and vaccine. However, 2 CBP breakthrough animal had transient viremia and never seroconverted. If these animals were considered protected the efficacy of the CBP would have been more than 30%. The CBP delayed SHIV acquisition in the breakthrough animals and viral load was reduced compared to controls, suggesting an interaction between the preventions. The authors suggested the vaccine established immunity that controlled SHIV infection, while the microbicide delayed virus replication and spread. A limitation of the study is that the class of zinc finger inhibitor evaluated has not been evaluated for HIV prevention in humans. Nevertheless, this study provided proof-of-concept that combining vaccines with microbicides could be beneficial over either prevention alone.</p><p>Barouch et&#160;al. evaluated two primarily T-cell inducing adenovirus-based vaccines in combination with vaginal gels containing the fusion inhibitor T-1249 or the CCR5-targeted entry inhibitor maraviroc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table&#160;1</xref>).<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Neither of the vaccines was protective alone but when combined with the gels, efficacy appeared to increase, to 30% against vaginal SIV challenge and to 67% against vaginal SHIV<sub>162P3</sub> challenge. The study was done in rhesus macaques treated with the hormone Depo-Provera to produce vaginal thinning. Animals received one high dose SIV challenge. The sample size (n = 6) in the individual arms of this study was smaller than in the Cheng-Mayer study, but the CBP significantly reduced acquisition compared to controls. The authors hypothesized that the microbicides delayed virus expansion, allowing vaccine-raised immune responses to prevent or control infection. Adenovirus-based vaccines and CCR5 directed drugs continue to be evaluated in humans as possible HIV-prevention strategies.</p><p>Le Grand et&#160;al. evaluated a tenofovir-containing vaginal gel combined with a protein-based HIV-vaccine candidate designed to induce T- and B-cell immunity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table&#160;1</xref>).<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> The vaccine had proteins from clades B and C, adjuvanted with MF59, which is being used in the next phase III canarypox-gp120 HIV vaccine efficacy trial in Southern Africa, or a novel toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist. It was given intramuscularly and intranasally to cynomolgous macaques to induce mucosal immunity. The vaccine had no protection against repeated SHIV<sub>162P3</sub> challenges when given alone. The 1% tenofovir gel alone had 46% efficacy after 6 vaginal challenges, mimicking the protection seen in the CAPRISA 004 trial of this gel.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> When vaccine and gel were combined, efficacy increased, as at 6 challenges protection was 81%. The CBP also provided protection at 12 and 22 challenges.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> The gel may have limited mucosal viral burden, providing time for vaccine-raised immunity to expand and amplify the PrEP efficacy. While next generation human HIV vaccines are unlikely to include a protein alone, the fact that the protein-based vaccine appeared to amplify protection provided by the tenofovir gel suggests that this CBP may hold promise for humans.</p><p>None of these previous studies evaluated oral PrEP with Truvada, the only approved PrEP for HIV-1 prevention, and all modeled vaginal acquisition of HIV. Rectal acquisition of HIV-1 is a key driver of the MSM HIV-1 epidemic and a significant mode of HIV infection in women. <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref></p><p>Ross et&#160;al. determined whether combining a polyvalent humoral-based vaccine with a human-equivalent dose of oral PrEP, would protect against rectal SHIV challenge in rhesus macaques.<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> The DNA/virus-like particle vaccine encoded HIV-1 Env and SIVmac239 Gag, was given intramuscularly and was boosted with intramuscular and intranasal injections of alum-adjuvanted Gag and Env particles. This combination had been shown to partially protect against vaginal SHIV challenge.<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> Intermittent treatment with oral PrEP (TDF and FTC in doses equivalent to human oral Truvada) was given 2&#160;hours before and 22&#160;hours after rectal SHIV<sub>162P3</sub> challenge. This regimen was known to have partial efficacy against rectal SHIV.<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> The combination of vaccine and PrEP protected 7/8 animals. Although the study used historical efficacy data for PrEP alone, modeling approaches<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> applied to the data suggested that given an additive model, the CBP would have been predicted to be 83.5% protective, which is similar to the 87.5% protection observed. The model also suggested that negative or subtractive interactions of vaccine and PrEP did not occur. Interestingly, SHIV exposures during PrEP amplified vaccine-raised antibody titers in protected animals and the one CBP animal that became infected had a reduced peak VL compared to controls and early, high avidity antibodies to env and gag. These results suggest that combining oral PrEP with HIV vaccines could enhance protection against HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, the oral PrEP may have allowed HIV exposures to amplify vaccine-raised immune responses providing immunologic and pharmacologic synergy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0007"><title>Potential impact of CBP on post-infection viremia</title><p>Analysis of breakthrough infections in animals who have received CBP can be very informative, depending on the study design. For example, PrEP only or CBP animals may continue to receive PrEP for a period of time following infection since there is an eclipse of &#8764;1&#160;week between when infection occurs and peripheral blood RNA becomes positive. Moreover, by convention, most researchers require 2 consecutive viral RNA tests be positive and some studies continue PrEP until all the controls become infected (as done in the Ross et&#160;al study). The presence of drug following infection in the NHP models mimics the human situation where individuals are intermittently tested for HIV infection and are likely to continue to receive drug or microbicide for some time after HIV infection. This along with vaccine-raised immune responses may provide an added benefit by limiting the size of the viral reservoir. The NHP studies of CBP support that this is likely. First, in the 5 studies evaluated, peak and set point viremia were frequently lower in the breakthrough CBP animals. Second, the 3 animals with transient, seronegative viremia (2 in the Cheng-Meyer et&#160;al. study and one in the Ross et&#160;al. study<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43, 47</sup></xref> suggest that CBP may have controlled and cleared local infections.

More intensive evaluation of mucosal samples for viral reservoirs, drug levels or mucosal immune responses could elucidate these interactions in future CBP studies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0008"><title>Theoretical human study designs for evaluating combined, partially effective biomedical preventions</title><p>Discussions about combining an HIV vaccine with other biomedical preventions in humans have been ongoing.

They provide expected numbers of incident infections in 4 different scenarios where combined vaccine and PrEP (VAXPREP) effects could be compared to vaccine, PrEP or no prevention. The scenarios are 2&#215;2 factorial designs evaluating HIV incidence with or without an effect on viral load in participants who became infected. One of these scenarios (scenario B in<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> and described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#160;2A</xref>) was selected for discussion since with increased early HIV treatment today, it may be impossible to determine effects on viral load. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#160;2A</xref> shows 4 study arms: placebo, vaccine, PrEP and VAXPREP (here termed CBP) and the outcome of interest is HIV incidence. Vaccine and PrEP efficacy were each set at 30%, additive and synergistic effects of vaccine and PrEP were modeled and background HIV incidence in the trial population was assumed to be 2%. In this model, if synergy of the CBP occurred, 80 incident infections and a sample size of &#8764;4900 would provide adequate power to detect the effect on reduced HIV incidence. However, if vaccine and PrEP effects were additive, 200 incident infections and a much larger sample size would be needed. Given that enhancement of HIV-incidence by an HIV vaccine has been observed, the authors discuss designs to detect enhancement and note that this 4 arm design could possibly detect enhancing effects during interim monitoring<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref>.

Note that both prevention arms have the alternative placebo, reducing the chance of unblinding.

Although, at this time, oral Truvada as PrEP had not been approved in the US or other countries, questions arose as to whether it should be provided as part of the prevention package and how use might impact HIV-incidence. The HVTN 505 trial had not been powered to detect a reduction in HIV incidence, only a reduction in viral load in vaccine recipients who became infected. The HVTN study team considered several options including that illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#160;2B</xref>. After much discussion among trial investigators and community, the HVTN 505 trial sample size was increased to 2200 to detect a vaccine efficacy of 50% reduction in incidence and PrEP use by trial participants was monitored.

The PrEP efficacy in the population may be risk-group dependent. Indeed, in a first for the HIV prevention field, a non-inferiority study is launching in 2016 in MSM. Known as HPTN 083, the study compares a new injectable form of PrEP (the integrase inhibitor cabotegravir, also known as CAB LA or GSK744) to oral PrEP with Truvada for HIV prevention.<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> MSM and transgender women, expected to have incidence &gt;2%, will receive intramuscular CAB and oral PrEP placebo pills or oral PrEP with placebo injections in a double blind, double-dummy design.

Future trials of biomedical preventions for HIV may not include placebo or double placebo arm.

Designs could include those similar to the HPTN 083 study or other 2 or 3 arm designs (such as designs C and D of Janes et&#160;al.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref>). Trials will also need to consider the different impact of transiently used preventions (e.g. PEP, PrEP) or permanent preventions (e.g., voluntary male circumcision) as discussed. <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0011"><title>Ethical and other considerations</title><p>Combinations of preventions may introduce ethical, regulatory and laboratory challenges that are more complex than a trial of one product alone. Institutional review boards, drug regulatory and other such bodies will need to assess the standard of care that will be provided during the trial and following the trial if the CBP is effective. Unique features of each prevention may also influence aspects of design and counseling. For example, candidate HIV vaccines, particularly those containing Env and Gag may induce false reactive HIV-tests, requiring specialized approaches to testing vaccinees for HIV infection. Persons receiving oral PrEP may face stigma related to a perception they are HIV infected if they are receiving pills usually used to treat HIV infection. Acceptability and likely adherence to particular PrEP products may vary depending on the population of trial participants, including age, gender, cultural factors and the like.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0012"><title>Logical selection of combinations</title><p>Trials of combined biomedical preventions should be informed by the mechanism of action and likely interactions of the preventions. For example, a non-vaccine prevention that prevents virus replication or integration after HIV enters target cells (as do Truvada, dapivarine and CAB) might be best combined with a prevention that blocks HIV entry into target cells (such as neutralizing antibodies or a vaccine that induces strong antibody responses). Or an entry-blocking drug such as maraviroc or another drug directed at the entry-receptor CCR5, might best be combined with a T-cell-based vaccine that targets infected cells for killing after they become infected. These effects would likely be additive. Synergy might be expected if a vaccine induced both entry-blocking and post-entry effects (e.g. B-cell and T-cell responses) and the drug, or other prevention had entry or post-entry effects. Mucosal and other interactions should be anticipated. For example, activation of HIV-specific immune cells on HIV-exposure of an HIV vaccine recipient will result in a local influx into vaginal or rectal tissues of targets for HIV entry. Moreover, increased levels of dATP in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells could reduce tenofovir efficacy on viral reverse transcription by competing as a substrate.<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Conversely, tenofovir shifts the IL-10/IL-12 balance of stimulated cells in vitro and therefore could modulate in vivo immune responses.<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref> While evaluating these tissue-level interactions cannot be done in humans, in vivo studies in animals, particularly NHP can more easily predict the magnitude and type of interaction. These data can guide selection of combinations and human trial design.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0013"><title>What efficacy should be expected for combined biomedical preventions?</title><p>There is no universally agreed on &#8220;bar&#8221; or &#8220;cut-off&#8221; for HIV prevention efficacy that may lead to a recommendation by a national or international body for implementation or approval of that prevention. Generally, clinical trials of HIV vaccines, microbicides and PrEP are powered to detect efficacy of at least 50%. Reproduction of efficacy in one or more trials of the same product is a key factor in leading to recommendations for implementation. This was the case for oral PrEP with Truvada and tenofovir, where multiple trials<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5-10</sup></xref> showed efficacies close to or above 50%.</p><p>However, even when efficacy is less than 50%, if a product shows promise and is replicated in a second trial, steps toward approval may begin. As an example, in the ASPIRE and The Ring studies<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,20</sup></xref> intravaginal rings delivering dapivarine as topical PrEP reduced HIV incidence by 27&#8211;31%.

In the example shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#160;2A</xref>, Exler et&#160;al.<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> modeled HIV vaccine and PrEP efficacies of 30%. If an additive effect was predicted, combination of an RV144-like vaccine with efficacy of &#8764;30% with a dapivarine-like intravaginal ring with &#8764;30% efficacy would yield overall efficacy of &#8764;51% but if synergy was observed, efficacy would likely be higher (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#160;2A</xref>).

Decisions about the efficacy which a CBP should reach for a clinical trial or for consideration for recommendations for use may vary based on the prevention and the intended population.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="s0001-0014"><title>The future of combined biomedical preventions</title><p>Today, since oral PrEP is effective and increasingly available, and an HIV vaccine is not, PrEP is the cornerstone of new biomedical preventions. As HIV-vaccines and other preventions continue to be evaluated, one situation where CBP may occur is in HIV vaccine or other trials where oral PrEP may be taken or offered as part of a prevention package for trial participants. When a protective HIV vaccine becomes available, vaccine might be administered to pre-teens or young adults prior to onset of sexual activity as for human papilloma virus vaccine, but PrEP may still have a role. In catch-up scenarios in sexually active individuals, PrEP (or other biomedical prevention) may be recommended until HIV vaccinations are complete, particularly if the HIV vaccine was known to be only partially effective. PrEP use may precede vaccination, if a person has missed vaccination, is sexually active, and then being referred for vaccination. PrEP may also be useful in a clinical trial if there is a concern regarding transient enhancement of HIV risk by an HIV vaccine since concurrent PrEP may allow immunity to be raised without the risk of enhancement. In the future, if HIV vaccines need periodic updating to deal with strain variation, as is the case with influenza vaccines, PrEP could be used for at-risk persons when immunity was being raised, or if they missed new vaccinations. On the other hand, HIV-vaccines may provide added benefit if circulating HIV strains have PrEP-resistant drug-mutations.</p><p>In the field of biomedical prevention there is a blurring of the boundaries between different types of preventions. While PrEP currently refers to prevention with systemically delivered anti-retroviral drugs, topical microbicides historically contained HIV-inhibitory compounds that were not typical anti-retroviral drugs. Now, topical HIV prevention includes many of the anti-retroviral drugs used for systemic PrEP. HIV-neutralizing antibodies are being evaluated as systemic PrEP, if given as injections but as topical PrEP/microbicides when being delivered mucosally in gels or vaginal rings. These antibodies or other novel HIV-blocking agents may be more akin to a vaccine or gene-therapy if delivered by viral vectors.</p><p>Several HIV preventions may be combined in one product (e.g., a tablet, vaginal ring, long acting injection, implant may deliver several anti-retroviral drugs, HIV-neutralizing antibodies, HIV microbicides or combinations thereof). Multipurpose preventions technologies (MPT) go one step further, adding approaches to prevent HSV-2, other STI and pregnancy in addition to HIV.<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> Could MPT also deliver vaccine components, such as gp120, to boost immunity from a prior vaccine series? Could vaccine immunizations be given concurrently with periodic intramuscular injections of a long-acting anti-retroviral PrEP modality?</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s0002"><title>Conclusion</title><p>With more than 5,000 new HIV infections occurring each day worldwide, it is important to discuss the obstacles to combining biomedical preventions modalities to accelerate an end to HIV/AIDS. Researchers in the PrEP, microbicide and HIV-vaccine fields could discuss ideal CBP combinations and their possible co-development or co-administration. Animal models could evaluate CBP concepts prior to clinical testing and guide clinical trial design.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest</title><p>No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>A part of this work was previously presented November 2015, Vaccine Renaissance 9 meeting, Providence, Rhode Isl.
