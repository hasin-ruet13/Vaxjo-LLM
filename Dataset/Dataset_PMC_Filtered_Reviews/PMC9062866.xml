Existing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines mainly include inactivated, live attenuated, viral vector, protein subunit, RNA, DNA, and virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines. Viral vector vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, and mRNA vaccines may induce additional cellular or humoral immune regulations, including Th cell responses and germinal center responses, and form relevant memory cells, greatly improving their efficiency. However, some viral vector or mRNA vaccines may be associated with complications like thrombocytopenia and myocarditis, raising concerns about the safety of these COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we systemically assess the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, including the possible complications and different effects on pregnant women, the elderly, people with immune diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplant recipients, and cancer patients. Based on the current analysis, governments and relevant agencies are recommended to continue to advance the vaccine immunization process. Simultaneously, special attention should be paid to the health status of the vaccines, timely treatment of complications, vaccine development, and ensuring the lives and health of patients. In addition, available measures such as mix-and-match vaccination, developing new vaccines like nanoparticle vaccines, and optimizing immune adjuvant to improve vaccine safety and efficacy could be considered.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Huahao Fan declares grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant No. 20SWAQK22, 2020YFA0712102), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 82151224), Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (grant No. BUCTZY2022), and H&amp;H Global Research and Technology Center (grant No. H2021028).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2022</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that spreads rapidly worldwide.

Small animals, especially rodents, are the foundation of biological and immunological studies in vaccine development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Generally, rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and other animals can be used as animal models to evaluate candidate vaccines&#8217; immunogenicity, tolerance, and safety. However, due to species differences between these animals and humans, similar biological effects may not be produced after vaccination. The studies of non-human primates (NHPs) are helpful in understanding and illustrating human immune responses, owing to similar innate and adaptive immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Many reagents used to identify human immune molecules also show similar effects on NHPs. In addition to preclinical trials (animal experiments), clinical trials are essential for developing vaccines. The safety, dosage, and tolerance of vaccines are assessed in the Phase I trial, efficacy and adverse effects are investigated in Phase II and III trials.</p><p id="Par5">Vaccination is a pivotal means to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and ultimately quell the pandemic. However, vaccine performance is affected by the constant acquisition of viral mutations due to the inherent high error rate of virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the existence of a highly variable receptor-binding motif in the spike (S) protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> We have previously noted that the B.1.351 (Beta) variant significantly reduces the neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) in recipients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> of mRNA and inactivated vaccines and may cause breakthrough infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> The reduction in neutralization activity has raised concerns about vaccine efficacy. Thus, rapid virus sequence surveillance (e.g. the identification of E484 mutations in new SARS-CoV-2 variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) and vaccine updates are crucial.</p><p id="Par6">This review systematically introduces the existing COVID-19 vaccine platforms, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of the vaccine routes, and compares the efficacy and safety of various vaccines, including the possible complications and different protective efficacies in special populations. Moreover, given the continuous mutation of SARS-CoV-2, we analyze the neutralization activities of various vaccines according to the latest research and propose ideas to improve and optimize existing vaccines, including changing the administration route, adopting more vaccination strategies, and applying more vaccine development methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The milestones of COVID-19 vaccine development.

By changing the administration route, the protection provided by vaccines can be enhanced, and more vaccination strategies are applied to cope with VOCs.

In this process, the immune system is activated. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells depend on antigen peptide (AP)-MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecular complex to differentiate into helper T cells (Th cells). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells depend on AP-MHC class I molecular complex and differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). B cells are activated with the help of Th cells to produce antibodies. After antigen stimulation, B and T cells form corresponding memory cells to protect the body from invading by the same pathogen, typically for several years. The development of COVID-19 vaccines is mainly based on seven platforms, which can be classified into three modes according to the antigen category.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> The first mode is based on the protein produced in vitro, including inactivated vaccines (inactivated SARS-CoV-2), VLP vaccines (virus particles without nucleic acid), and subunit vaccines (S protein or receptor-binding domain (RBD) expressed in vitro). The second model is based on the antigen gene expressed in vivo, including viral vector vaccines (using replication-defective engineered viruses carrying the mRNA of S protein or RBD), DNA vaccines (DNA sequences of S protein or RBD), and mRNA vaccines (RNA sequences of S protein or RBD). The third mode is the live-attenuated vaccine. These vaccines can induce neutralizing antibodies to protect recipients from viral invasion. Moreover, some mRNA and viral vector vaccines can induce Th1 cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and persistent human germinal center responses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> which provide more efficient protection.

In addition to Del69/70, there are eight mutations in the S protein of Alpha variant: Del144 (contained in 95% of all detected sequences of Alpha variants), N501Y (97.6%), A570D (99.2%), D614G (99.3%), P681H (99%), T716I (98.7%), S982A (98.8%), and D1118H (99.2%) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://outbreak.info/">https://outbreak.info/</ext-link>). Among these mutations, Del69/70 and Del144 can significantly reduce the neutralization of NTD targeted antibodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref></sup> because most of the immune epitopes of NTD antibodies are located in N3 (residues 141-156) and N5 (residues 246&#8211;260) loops, while Del144 can alter the N3 loop and cause the immune escape of such antibodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref></sup> Del69/70 can enhance the infectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref></sup> The characteristic mutation N501Y can significantly increase the binding of S protein to ACE2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref></sup> and further enhance the infectivity.

These mediators increased the destructive effect of monocyte macrophages on erythrocytes and led to abnormal platelet levels. In addition, the injury of epithelial cells activated platelets and released coagulation factors, finally forming fibrin and forming extensive micro thrombosis. In this process, the over-consumed platelets and coagulation factors lead to the reduction of coagulation activity, further imbalance of coagulation and anticoagulation, secondary hyperfibrinolysis, and the release of a large number of plasminogen activators, eventually leaded to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which appeared in most COVID-19 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref></sup> Compared with COVID-19 patients, fewer mRNA vaccine subjects reported DIC, which may be due to the lower amount of S protein produced after vaccination than natural infection, and the inflammation is also lower.</p><p id="Par95">Relevant indexes (e.g., measuring prothrombin time, platelet count, and D-dimer concentrations of the receptors) should be tested within 2&#8211;3 days after vaccination to prevent the platelet abnormalities caused by COVID-19 vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref></sup> For patients with abnormal index, preventive treatment (usually heparin or low molecular weight heparin transfusion, the latter is safer) should be taken as soon as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref></sup> In addition, degranulation inhibitors may also be a feasible means to inhibit the inflammatory response and prevent lung injury and platelet abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Heart diseases</title><p id="Par96">Myocarditis is a rare cardiac complication after COVID-19 vaccine injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> Rosner et al. reported seven patients hospitalized for acute cardiomyoid disease after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech/AstraZeneca (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6) and Janssen (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;1) vaccines.

Given the low proportion of overall incidence of adverse events of vaccines and the fact that some complications occur mainly in patients with underlying diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and tumors). Governments and relevant agencies are recommended to accelerate the vaccine immunization process. Simultaneously, special attention should be paid to the health status of the recipients, timely treatment of complications, vaccine development, and ensuring the lives and health of patients.

The existing vaccine strategies are difficult to effectively prevent infections caused by the Omicron variant, which is not only due to the accumulation of more mutation sites in the S protein, but also because the Omicron variant mainly causes upper respiratory tract infection, while the protective antibodies induced by i.m route are often directed at the lower respiratory tract (lung). In this case, changing or adjusting vaccination strategies is very significant to control the infections and alleviate public health pressure. We believe that the following points deserve attention: (1) Although a booster dose can enhance the response of memory cells and increase the antibody titers to produce a stronger protective effect, the fourth dose injection might not effectively Omicron variant infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref></sup> (2) The optimization of COVID-19 vaccines, such as changing the administration route (use the inhaled vaccine and induced mucosal immunity to protect the upper respiratory tract further), developing new vaccines (for inactivated vaccines, the combined use of seed strain of VOCs like Beta&#8201;+&#8201;Delta may induce antibodies with multi-epitopes, as well as the use of VOC sequence for mRNA or viral vector vaccines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref></sup>) and adopting sequential immunization (the use of vaccines developed in different routes like inactivated&#8201;+&#8201;viral vector vaccine/mRNA vaccine) will provide better protection than existing vaccination strategies.
