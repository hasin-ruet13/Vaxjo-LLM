Coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), have threatened human life, with immense accompanying morbidity rates; the COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has become a severe threat to global public health. In addition, the design process of antiviral medications usually takes years before the treatments can be made readily available. Hence, it is necessary to invest scientifically and financially in a technology platform that can then be quickly repurposed on demand to be adequately positioned for this kind of pandemic situation through lessons learned from the previous pandemics. Nanomaterials/nanoformulations provide such platform technologies, and a proper investigation into their basic science and biological interactions would be of great benefit for potential vaccine and therapeutic development. In this respect, intelligent and advanced nano-based technologies provide specific physico-chemical properties, which can help fix the key issues related to the treatments of viral infections. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest research on the effective use of nanomaterials in the treatment of coronaviruses. Also raised are the problems, perspectives of antiviral nanoformulations, and the possibility of using nanomaterials effectively against current pandemic situations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="ga1_lrg.jpg"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>Coronaviruses</kwd><kwd>Immunization</kwd><kwd>Virus-like particles</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>Antiviral</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Viral infections can pose a considerable threat to human health due to their troublesome widespread distribution and their ability to adapt through genetic mutations. The large number of fatalities caused by such infections has also become a huge concern for healthcare systems over the past few decades [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite tremendous scientific advancements, human beings frequently find themselves helpless when faced with new threats resulting from the emergence of new viruses. Viruses are the cause of about one-third of infectious disease deaths. Some old pathogens have reappeared in the past 20 years, and several new infectious pathogens, especially viruses, have emerged, among them, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acute respiratory infections becoming the world's leading causes of mortality [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The lack of tools to tackle virulent diseases or a slow response to a pandemic outbreak may have significant social and economic effects.</p><p id="p0040">The human respiratory mucosa seems to be the most significant conduit and the primary route for various viruses (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial, and parainfluenza viruses) to invade or infect. In the first case, these virulent pathogens first attack the upper respiratory tract and then enter the lower breathing airways, progressing to diseases [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. They usually reach the host through airborne infections and transmit by direct contact or droplets/aerosols, replicate effectively in the respiratory tract, and often show clinical symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, cough, bronchiolitis and pneumonia [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The majority of respiratory tract diseases are caused by one of the numerous respiratory viruses, particularly influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, rhinoviruses, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome that infect the lower respiratory tract. In addition, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, enterovirus, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus are common causes of respiratory viral infection, especially in young children [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. SARS, the most recent infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is typically an acute type of bronchopneumonia [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The family Coronaviridae, commonly known as coronaviruses, consists of two subfamilies: Torovirinae and Coronavirinae [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Coronavirus and coronavirus-like infections such as avian infectious bronchitis, transmissible gastroenteritis, porcine epidemic diarrhea, and feline infectious peritonitis have been identified in various wild and livestock animals, including swine, poultry, and cats [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Coronaviruses in humans include several viruses that cause the common cold and more serious respiratory diseases, including Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All recent coronavirus epidemics have appeared unexpectedly and rapidly transmitted. Not only can they endanger public wellbeing, but they can also lead to disastrous consequences [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The first occurrence of &#8220;SARS coronavirus&#8221; infection resulted in a fatality rate of ~10%, with more than 8000 reported cases [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Ten years later, Middle East respiratory syndrome appeared in a global epidemic in 2012, spread nearly 27 countries/regions with 2494 individuals infected with a 34.4% mortality rate [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Many individual cases of new coronavirus infection, COVID-19, as a potentially deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), were reported in late 2019 and early 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is notably more likely to appear in the elderly community, especially in people with hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, or coronary heart disease. On May 19, 2021, we are witnessing a worldwide spread of the novel corona virus with 163, 869, 893 positive cases, at least more than 3,398,302 deaths, and spread across 222 countries [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Various types of candidate vaccines and proposed antiviral drugs/agents are currently being evaluated in clinical trials on their potential effects against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p id="p0045">The design phase of antiviral medications generally takes years before the treatments can be made readily available since many legislative procedures are needed to evaluate vaccines and drugs' safety and effectiveness [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In particular, the repurposing of existing medications is actually at the forefront of study from a clinical perspective against COVID-19. The lack of time is one of the critical reasons for the current repurposing of medications and rapid preclinical and clinical testing of COVID-19 vaccine formulations [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. The development, clinical trials, and new drug clearance typically take years to complete. Hence, it is necessary to invest scientifically and financially in the technology platform that can then be quickly repurposed on demand to be adequately positioned for this kind of pandemic situation through lessons learned from the previous pandemics. Nanodevices and nanoformulations provide such platform technologies, and a proper investigation into their basic science and biological interactions would be of great benefit for potential vaccine and therapeutic development [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">For decades, nanomaterials have been used in various pharmaceutical applications, such as distributing nano-therapeutic molecules by crossing certain barriers (such as epithelial/endothelial, immune, or cell barriers) so that drugs can be targeted and delivered to specific sites without affecting healthy tissues or nano-vaccines targeting certain diseased organs or cell types, and communicate through biomolecules found in the blood or organ tissues [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>]. In addition, the use of engineered nanomaterials to inactivate viruses or prevent virus binding to host cell surface receptors are some of the notable features of nanoscale antiviral therapies [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, nanocarriers can transmit antigens effectively due to the simplicity of surface functionalization and the ability to carry multi-adjuvanted antigens [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nanomaterials have been used in targeted therapies, namely active and passive targeting. Passive targeting could occur in a targeted nanoparticulate delivery system due to the increased permeability (due to inflammation or malignancy) of a vascular system of a particular site, which can result in the accumulation of more nanotherapeutic agents in the diseased site. Conversely, active targeting includes the incorporation of target ligands (e.g., antibodies, sugars, peptides, proteins, etc.) to steer the nanotherapeutics to a particular receptor, site, or epitope [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>].</p><p id="p0055">In this perspective review, we have considered the use of nano-based formulation approaches against previously known coronaviruses (middle east respiratory coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and feline coronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2 that are being developed as delivery carriers, including novel nanovaccine transfer platforms and effective nanodrugs to treat viral infection. Undoubtedly, these approaches used for previous epidemics of coronavirus would greatly benefit for potential vaccine and therapeutic development for the current pandemic and prevention of its explosive spread globally.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Application of nanomaterial in the treatment of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus</title><p id="p0060">Since being first reported in a Saudi Arabic patient in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has become a novel cause of severe acute respiratory disease [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported worldwide at the end of November 2019, including 858 related fatalities (case-fatality rate: 34.4%), according to a study from the World Health Organisation (WHO); most of these reported incidents from Saudi. MERS-CoV belongs to the order Nidovirales, the Coronaviridae family. It's among the newest zoonotic viruses identified. The Coronaviridae genus is classified into different genera (&#945;, &#946;, &#255;, and &#255;). Each category is broken down into lineages within subgroups. MERS-CoV belongs to the &#946;-coronavirus family C. MERS-CoV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus consisting of a 30-base pair genome that encodes RNA polymerase and four specific coronaviridae structural proteins. Spike (S), the virus' only surface glycoprotein that mediates virus attachment and fusion through the host cognate receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is the most immunogenic of these proteins [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The main objective of most current MERS-CoV vaccine research is to produce neutralizing antibodies to this unique spike protein of MERS-CoV, as the spike protein has been the most immunogenic structural protein. While several approaches have been reported to produce the MERS-CoV vaccine, no clinically approved MERS-CoV vaccine is available. Various forms of vaccines, including vector-based vaccines, subunit vaccines, and DNA vaccines, have been studied in previous research. Among these, neutralizing antibodies have been successfully developed and protected against infection by viral vector vaccine or immunization with DNA [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, it is not possible to ignore health issues regarding DNA vaccines, their inadequate induction of neutralizing antibodies, and the possibility for decreased efficiency of viral vector vaccines due to pre-existing viral vector immunity triggered by repeated immunization. Although protein subunit vaccines can provoke the neutralizing antibodies, the induction of cellular immune responses is relatively poor. In addition, subunit vaccines have not been able to induce adequate host immune responses, which resulted in a lack of long-lasting memory to an antigen [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p id="p0065">Not unsurprisingly, in the fields of vaccine research and manufacturing, emerging approaches that overcome such limits are a high priority. Virus-like particles (VLPs), nanoparticles (NPs), and multimeric peptide assemblies offer attractive platforms for the development of vaccines [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Attention should be paid to choosing a stable and reliable NP assembly system to produce NP vaccines that encourage cost-effective production and timely delivery of vaccines. In addition, most approaches consider the thermodynamic stability of the final assembled NPs without proper recognition of the kinetic complexities that govern regular assembly over spontaneous interactions leading to misfolded aggregations [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>].</p><p id="p0070">VLPs and NPs structurally mimic infectious virions but are nonpathogenic owing to a lack of viral genomes. The recombinant surface antigens of natural virions are arranged in closely organized structures as hollow particles depleted of genetic material. Antigenic epitopes can be seen on the NPs&#8217; multivalent and highly repetitive surface, which contributing to B-cell receptors' crosslinking and the activation of long-term immune responses [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>]. The regularly formed particles are highly immunogenic and are capable of diagnosing and prophylactic exploitation by imitating the presence of the actual infectious virions [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Matrix protein assemblies provide a molecular scaffold in the enveloped VLPs, and the lipid membrane encapsulates viral antigens. Various forms of glycoproteins can be incorporated as target antigens in the lipid membrane to produce immunological responses. However, several proteins (surface antigens and matrix proteins) are required in this process, and the enveloped VLPs are structurally incoherent and difficult to characterize. A possible solution is to incorporate the specific antigens to the surface of the self-assembled NPs that serve as the macromolecular scaffold for expressing the antigens of concern instead of the lipid membranes [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p id="p0075">Lin et al.

In comparison, NP(cdGMP) will approach the lymphatic system preferentially, minimizing systemic reactogenicity. With a negligible effect on cdGMP encapsulation performance, the surface linker incorporation efficiency was around 70% for NP(cdGMP). Notably, the antibody reaction in mice immunized with nanoparticle vaccine has been substantially enhanced by the amount of receptor binding domain-specific immunoglobulin G2a (RBD-specific IgG2a) antibodies, while free MF59 (immunologic adjuvant) and cdGMP-adjuvanted RBD antigens induced minimal levels of IgG2a. The hollow PLGA nanoparticles have offered tunable encapsulation efficiencies and controlled release of aqueous-soluble STING agonists compared to the low encapsulation efficiencies of PLGA-based nanoformulations for aqueous-soluble compounds in earlier studies [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This was due to the lower viscosity of the low molecular weight (10,000&#160;Da) polymer dissolved in the organic solvent, relative to the high-molecular-weight polymer. Interfacial surface tensions were decreased in the double emulsion-based PLGA nanoparticles with the low-molecular-weight polymer solution, producing highly stable core-shell structures and high cdGMP solution encapsulation. Furthermore, there were combined advantages of biocompatibility, size consistency, colloidal stability, pH-responsive release, tunable adjuvant loading for the hollow polymeric nanoparticle. In order to modulate immune stimulation and functionalization of nanoparticles, this viromimetic nanoparticle can be further modified for particular vaccination requirements that could apply to the several viral infections that endanger public health.</p><p id="p0085">Viral antigens from human pathogens are likely to misfold into aggregates, which necessitates the chemical restoration of these insoluble aggregates to restore solubility and allow normal antigen assembly. Kim et al. [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] used ferritin as a molecular scaffold to prepare novel bacterial NP of MERS-CoV antigen for self-assembly and prevent spike glycoprotein agglomeration into irregular conformations. Ferritin found in most biological species has 24 similar subunits that spontaneously attach and form nanoparticle complexes with 8 and 12&#160;nm internal and external diameters. RNA molecules are capable of providing new molecular functions like molecular chaperons. In this study, the function of chaperna (chaperone&#160;+&#160;RNA) was exploited using a bacterial expression system for folding and hybrid ferritin monomer (HFM) assembly into nanoparticles. MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S) has been used to prepare MERS-CoV-like NPs. The protein folding efficiency and the development of NPs can be further increased by choosing suitable linkers. In addition, Fe<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and salt concentrations have affected the efficiency and uniformity of the regular assembly into NPs of HFM. Furthermore, RNA binding avoided agglomeration into irregular conformations and steered the self-assembly of HFM into stable structure NPs. Immunization results exhibited that receptor-binding domain-SSG (linker)-bacterioferritin (RBD-[SSG]-FR) NPs induce a more robust local immune response compared to RBD. In addition, the antibody responses of IgG, IgG1 (Th1), IgG2a, and IgG2b (Th2) against MF59-adjuvanted antigens were reported to be greater than those of alum-adjuvanted antigens. Cellular immune responses of RBD-FR and RBD-[SSG]-FR immune groups were significantly increased relative to the RBD and FR immune groups.</p><p id="p0090">Many MERS-CoV vaccines have been clinically unapproved due to lower cellular immune response levels and failure to develop long-lasting antigen memory. A heterologous prime-boost immunization technique was developed to address these limitations that combine recombinant adenovirus serotype 5, delivering the MERS-CoV spike protein gene (Ad5/MERS) and MERS spike protein nanoparticles [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The purified spike glycoprotein nanoparticles were obtained using combined processes of anion exchange and glucose affinity chromatography. Ad5/MERS was used to trigger the cellular immune response in the first (priming) vaccine, and then MERS spike protein nanoparticles were used to trigger the humoral immune response in the second and third vaccines (first and second booster). By priming with Ad5/MERS and by boosting with MERS spike protein nanoparticles, the cellular immune response can be effectively triggered and circumvent viral vectors' limitations. In addition, this prime-boost immunization demonstrated a balanced activation of T helper cell type 1 and 2 (Th1 and Th2) immune responses since it successfully incorporates the benefits of both a viral vector vaccine and a protein vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Application of nanomaterial in the treatment of infectious bronchitis virus</title><p id="p0095">For the global poultry sector, avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an emerging contagious respiratory infection with high economic importance.

IBV &#8242;s primary immunogen is the S1 subunit protein, bound to the membrane by interaction with the S2 subunit, which is involved in viral entry and produces epitopes that induce the production of potent neutralizing antibodies as well as hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>].</p><p id="p0110">Proper IBV vaccination may help in preventing the occurrence of clinical IB and associated poultry airsacculitis. However, in various parts of the world, variants of avian infectious bronchitis are continually emerging and can weaken the immunity provoked by commercial anti-IBV vaccines developed using classical viral strains. Therefore, to monitor the infection caused by new strains of IBV, live attenuated vaccines developed with regional specific variants have also been formulated in several countries. However, outbreaks of indigenous IBV genotype strains continuously occur and affect the poultry &#8216;s respiratory and urogenital tracts. For example, the Massachusetts serotype live-attenuated vaccine is widely used in Brazil, but the outbreak of the BR-I native strain continues to affect respiratory and genitourinary tracts of chickens. In addition, previous studies have shown that this vaccine against IBV BR-I variant strains offers only partial cross-protection in the experimental condition [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>]. Moreover, there are several risks involved with adopting live attenuated vaccines, including reversion of virulence, recombination with virulent field strains, and mild tissue injuries that may gradually develop into significant secondary infections [<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In addition to live attenuated vaccines, inactivated IBV vaccines have also been widely investigated; however, they provoked a weak mucosal immune response. High concentrations of antigens and multiple immunizations are typically needed for inactivated IBV vaccines to induce successful immune responses. Furthermore, local injuries are also detected when using specified administration routes (intramuscular or subcutaneous) [<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>].</p><p id="p0115">New IB vaccine formulations are widely attempted to address the shortcomings described above. Considering the increasing need for improved vaccine technologies against emerging infectious threats, the delivery of antigens and adjuvants through synthetic nanoparticles has demonstrated immense potential for enhancing the vaccine's safety and efficacy. Particulate vaccines have been designed to mimic virus-like features, such as nanoscale morphology, multivalent antigen display, and antigen/adjuvant compartmentalization to facilitate the involvement of immune cells and the processing of antigens. In addition, particles at the nanoscale exhibited improved lymphatic transport than smaller subunit antigens. Displaying multiple antigens on a single nanoscale particle makes it much easier for the immune cells to present antigens more effectively. This excellent immune response potential of virus-like particles has led to synthetic nanomaterials to mimic virus properties to develop vaccines. Due to the high radii of curvature, synthetic nanoparticles usually possess high surface energies that cause biomolecules to adsorb in a process known as protein corona formation. A strong association of nanoparticles/proteins arises naturally as a means of passivating surface energies in protein-rich media, and these particles are contained in a protein layer that determines the particles' interactions with the environment. Due to its importance in biomedical applications, the production of protein corona is increasingly gaining scientific attention (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, sVLPs were synthesized by the association of spike glycoprotein on the gold nanoparticles' surfaces exploiting the nanoparticles' high passivate surface energies [<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The full spike glycoprotein from the avian IB virus was obtained using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. The spontaneous association of antigen-particle was obtained by mixing purified spike proteins with gold nanoparticles in 10% sucrose and optimized incubation conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). The size of the nanoparticle increased from 100.6&#160;nm to 139.2&#160;nm with protein corona formation.</p><p id="p0120">Results showed that antigen delivery increased by 6-fold with sVLPs compared to the free protein formulation. This was due to the strong adhesion of protein/particle on the nanoparticle surface and the facilitation of in vivo antigen transport by particle carrier. In addition, sVLPs exhibited noticeably higher antibody (IgG) levels, providing enhanced vaccination potency relative to free protein formulation. The improved immunogenicity was due to the increased antigen delivery to the lymph node and particulate nature inducing the other immune activation mechanisms. The sVLP sample indicated high levels of IFN-g mRNA relative to free protein and the whole inactivated vaccine samples, showing significant enhancement of antigen-specific cellular immunity. Finally, sVLPs immunized animal samples showed steadily decreased viral load due to the lowest relative viral mRNA expression.</p><p id="p0125">Conventional inactivated IBV vaccinations normally induce decreased mucosal immune responses and local protection. In order to overcome these limitations, several nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery systems have been developed. For example, BR-I genotype strain encapsulated chitosan nanoparticle (IBV-CS), inactivated IBV vaccine, was developed using an ionic gelation technique to be administered via the oculo-nasal route to chickens [<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The ionic gelation technique was used to produce the IBV-CS vaccine. Briefly, the embryo infectious dose obtained in the allantoic fluid was added dropwise in 0.05% chitosan, followed by adding sodium tripolyphosphate in the solution under magnetic stirring and incubation at room temperature. After that, the centrifugation step was followed to precipitate IBV-CS. The encapsulation efficiency was around 85%, and the size of the spherical-shaped nanoparticles was 286&#160;nm. Results indicated that all vaccinated groups with IBV-CS formed a pronounced anti-IBV IgA and IgG antibody development memory at the upper respiratory tract mucosal sites. Also, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) memory responses showed early increases in tracheal IFN&#947; gene expression relative to non-vaccinated and challenged chickens. In addition, Zhao, et al. [<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] has prepared N-2-hydroxypropyl ammonium chloride chitosan (N-2-HACC) and N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) as an adjuvant and carrier for IBV vaccine antigens. The water solubility of quaternized chitosan exceeded that of the chitosan. It preserved the original characteristics of chitosan, including excellent bioavailability, low cost, biocompatibility, and the capability to open tight intracellular junctions. The water-soluble derivatives of chitosan, N-2-HACC, and CMC, have been prepared as nanoformulations for vaccine antigen delivery. The IBV antigen encapsulation into the N-2-HACC-CMC nanoparticles was achieved using a polyelectrolyte complex method. According to in vitro release assay, both NDV and IBV showed sustained release from nanoparticles after the initial burst release. Immunization studies revealed that IBV antigen encapsulated N-2-HACC-CMC nanoparticles induced the production of high levels of IgG and IgA antibodies intranasally, enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and higher amounts of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and interferon-&#255; (IFN-&#960;) production compared to commercially combined live attenuated vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Application of nanomaterial in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus</title><p id="p0130">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was reported for the first time in 2002, followed by a series of fatal pneumonia cases accompanied by inflammatory cellular infiltration with diffuse alveolar damage [<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].

Gold nanoparticle-adjuvanted S protein was prepared by Sekimukai et al. [<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] to induce antigen-specific IgG response against SARS-CoV infection. A baculovirus expression system was used to prepare the coronavirus S protein. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were obtained as a commercial gold colloid and coated with Bis(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-sulfonatophenyl)phenylphosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSSP). After that, the BSPP-coated AuNPs were mixed with purified recombinant S protein and incubated for conjugation at room temperature for 1&#160;h. The change of the diameter of AuNPs proved the conjugation of S protein. The levels of antigen-specific IgG in S-protein conjugated AuNP were considerably higher after animal immunization than in the S-protein immunized population. However, after the virus challenge, AuNP-adjuvanted S protein failed to provoke protective immune responses and limit eosinophilic infiltrations.

The S proteins were extracted from cell membranes using a non-ionic detergent, and the centrifugation step was followed to remove the insoluble materials. The combination of anion exchange, affinity, and size exclusion chromatography was used to purify the S proteins oligomers. The detergent's remainder is removed during the purification step, enabling the S trimers to assemble higher-ordered micellular protein-protein nanoparticles. According to the mice vaccination results, the nanoparticles of coronavirus S developed high levels of homologous virus-neutralizing antibodies. In addition, the use of adjuvant (alum) greatly improved responses to SARS-CoV S nanoparticles and also to MERS-CoV S nanoparticles in vaccinated mice. In addition, the production of neutralizing antibody levels was substantially increased by using alum or matrix M1 as adjuvants (15-fold with alum and 68-fold with matrix M1) relative to the neutralizing antibody levels generated due to S nanoparticles alone.</p><p id="p0155">Given that most respiratory disorders arise through the mucosal membrane, it is clear and desirable that the vaccine can activate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Because of its effective transfection and buffering capacity, polyethyleneimine (PEI) is used as a non-viral vector in vitro and in vivo.

The influence of chitosan's cationic charge density offers a high binding capacity with nucleic acids, enhancing the carrier properties of chitosan for gene delivery. It is expected that chitosan improves the nasal delivery potential in two ways. Firstly, chitosan's positive charge attaches to the negative sialic residues of nasal epithelial mucosa, thereby delaying clearance. Second, chitosan transiently opens tight junctions to facilitate enhanced paracellular transport through the nasal mucosa. Raghuwanshi et al. [<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] developed a nasal route vaccine delivery system using dendritic cell (DC) targeting chitosan nanoparticles. To achieve specific DC targeting, the plasmid DNA (PDNA) loaded charged biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were targeted with a bifunctional fusion protein (bfFp) vector. BfFp is a recombinant fusion protein composed of a single-chain anti-DEC-205 antibody (scFv) with truncated core-streptavidin. Fusion protein binds to biotinylated nanoparticles in its core streptavidin arm.

The modifications involved replacing cysteines with alanines and attaching the SARS HRC1 epitope to the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>-terminus to be repeatedly shown on the nanoparticles' surface. A significant feature of peptide nanoparticles is that a repeated antigen display system is generated when the monomers self-assemble.

HRC peptides were obtained by transferring enveloped plasmid into the Escherichia Coli strain expression cells. The peptide nanoparticles consist of self-assembled monomers were obtained by a stepwise dialysis process. The nanoparticles exhibited spherical shape with different sizes ranging from 25 to 30&#160;nm. According to immune responses in mice, the immunization using HRC1 nanoparticles demonstrated concentration-dependent neutralization of SARS-CoV infectivity; however, immunization with nanoparticles alone did not show significant neutralization activity. This system's immunogenic impact is due to the particle's nanometer scale, the repetitive epitope displays, and a strong mimicry of the native conformation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Application of nanomaterial in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</title><p id="p0175">A novel coronavirus causing pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019 and spread rapidly in China and abroad.

Similarly, Sarkar [<xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] proposed the nebulization of 10&#160;nm size water dispersed Ag NPs with bronchodilators using a simple nebulizer machine or bi-level ventilation for corona patients. The antiviral effect of Ag NPs may be attributed to the attachment of Ag NPs to RNA virus surface glycoproteins, preventing the virus from integrating into host cells.</p><p id="p0225">Aydemir and Ulusu [<xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] stated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had a protective role in COVID-19-associated lung injury caused by infection due to enhanced synthesis of vasodilator angiotensin 1&#8211;7. In addition, enhanced catalytic function and enzyme stability were shown when those enzymes were coated on specified nanoparticles. Therefore, using nanomaterials, ACE2-coated/embedded stable quantum dots or nanoflowers can be synthesized with the improved catalytic activity of ACE2 and used to manufacture masks, gloves, chewing gums, nose filters, and garments. These facts propose that such viruses will be captured by utilizing nanotechnology in products such as masks, clothes, chewing gums, gloves, etc., before reaching the host. Allergens and pollens are caught by nose filters before they reach the host. Like nasal filters, ACE2-coated nanoparticle contained chewing gums, clothes, filters, and gloves may trap and hold viruses before they reach the host.</p><p id="p0230">Graphene-based nanomaterials have been exquisitely explored in antiviral therapies owing to their exceptional physical and chemical modes of antimicrobial action on a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms. Graphene can modulate its electrical properties even though a single biomolecule is in contact with its surface, making it an ideal sensor surface. Oxygen in graphene offers an adsorption or functionalization site for proteins, enzymes, or nucleic acids. Graphene oxides (GOs) can specifically target analytes with chemically selective functionalization. In addition, targeted viral proteins can be efficiently identified by the antibody-conjugated GO sheets, and electronic nanomaterial properties can be coupled for signal amplification. Despite the low price of graphene products, it can be helpful not only in point-of-care or large population screening but also for the production of environmental sensors. The high specific surface area of graphene offers the best ligand contact surface for the adsorption of negatively charged sulphates. This, in turn will associate with virions&#8217; positively charged residues and prevent the entry of viruses. After that, the light absorption property of graphene may be applied to destroy the captured viral particles [<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. This graphene material has identical negative load density, which is possibly the key factor impacting the inhibition of the virus [<xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. It is reported that in combination with their aromatic plane, GO and reduced GO can adsorb charged lipids and degrade membranes [<xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>].</p><p id="p0235">Graphene derivatives have also been used as antiviral drug delivery platforms. For example, reverse transcriptase inhibitors conjugated with graphene quantum dots and hypericin-GO have been used to treat HIV and reovirus, respectively. Noticeably, hypericin is included as an antiviral agent in the list of computational identified alternative therapies for SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].</p><p id="p0240">This nanomaterial is also applicable to regulating the disease's epidemiological propagation, apart from therapeutic approaches based on graphene capture.

The detection limit of this sensor was 10&#160;ng/ml and it was able to detect exposure to the virus before the symptoms appeared. Similarly, future research could also involve the creation of SARS-CoV-2 sensors for epidemiological control of virus transmission through protective clothing. GO films are also useful in clothing to create breathable barrier layers. Graphene coatings can be used with silver nitrate and titanium dioxide nanoparticles to capture pathogens, as previously mentioned. It is also reported that protective graphene face masks can be recycled through photocatalysis or heat [<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].</p><p id="p0245">It takes time to produce a safe and effective vaccine, but thanks to the unprecedented advancement of scientific research and global cooperation, scientists were able to develop COVID-19 vaccines in a short time while ensuring rigorous, scientifically appropriate and evidence-based regulatory standards. The acceptance of a vaccine abides by a series of well-established international regulations. Vaccines are tested extensively by scientists before being approved by the regulatory health authorities to ensure their efficacy, safety, and effectiveness. Vaccines, along with antibiotics, are the strongest protection against infectious diseases that we have to date; nevertheless, no vaccination is 100% secure or effective for everyone. This is due to the fact that each person's body responds differently to vaccinations. Vaccines must go through the appropriate phases of clinical trials on human subjects before being included in the general public, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and the National Institute of Health (NIH). As more caution and consideration are given to the market product's quality, this mechanism is becoming more complex [<xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,<xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].</p><p id="p0250">A standard sequence of steps is followed in the development and testing of vaccines. Laboratory and animal studies are part of the preliminary stages, which are exploratory. Scientists identify natural or synthetic antigens that can help prevent or treat of disease at this time.

These experiments offer researchers an understanding of what cellular responses to expect in humans. They can also suggest a safe starting dosage and method of vaccine administration for the next step of the study. After that, the sponsor, usually a private company, submits an application describing the manufacturing and testing processes, laboratory reports and proposed study for an Investigational New Drug (IND) to the USFDA.

Immune responses are assessed using standardized and validated procedures. People receiving the candidate vaccine are compared with a controlled group who may receive an FDA-approved vaccine, a placebo or another substance.</p><p id="p0270">After a satisfactory phase III study, the vaccine manufacturer will submit a biologics license application to the FDA.

Following the release of a vaccine, drug companies can perform optional phase IV trials. The vaccine's manufacturer may continue to evaluate it for safety, effectiveness, and other potential applications. VAERS is a voluntary reporting system that investigates the adverse effects and tries to determine whether the vaccination caused those effects.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is one of the five enteric porcine coronaviruses identified to date. The main symptoms are vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss. The primary route of transmission of the virus is fecal-oral. Infected creatures are unable to digest food properly and die due to dehydration. The mortality rate can be greater than 90% and is inversely proportional to the pig's age [<xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Not like other porcine enteric CoVs, TGEV has both intestinal and respiratory tropisms, making it a useful model for studying the molecular determinants of coronavirus tissue tropism. TGEV is an RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviride. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of mature epithelial cells found at the tips of the small intestinal villi. TGE virions are circular, with an average diameter of 75&#8211;160&#160;nm, comprising a single-stranded RNA and a large number of nucleocapsid protein molecules [<xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Traditional vaccines for this infection have several drawbacks, such as up to 99% ballast chemicals, making the vaccine reactogenic, the presence of toxic antimicrobial chemicals (e.g., phenol, formaldehyde), and reduced immunogenicity because empty virus particles seem unable to trigger cellular immunity. In addition, inactivated vaccines are also considered to have low immunogenicity since empty virus particles cannot induce cellular immunity. Different methodologies have been developed to solve these issues, such as vaccination with nanoparticles as antigens and therapeutic agent carriers [<xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>].</p><p id="p0285">For example, Lv, et al. [<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] investigated the inhibitory effect of Ag nanoparticles, silver nanowires of 60&#160;nm and 400&#160;nm in diameter, and silver colloids on transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induced cell infection in vitro. A mixture of ammonium nitrate, polyoxyethylene, glycerol, trioleate, and tween 20 has been used to stabilize Ag nanoparticles. For the nanowires and the colloids, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as the coating agent. Nanowires with higher coating agents showed less cytotoxicity on TGEV-susceptible porcine cell line (ST cells) than NPs with less coatings. Additionally, relative to NPs, the larger size of nanowires could be less absorbed by ST cells. Results revealed that the Ag nanoparticles and Ag nanowires have considerable anti-TGEV action; however, the Ag colloids do not affect the multiplication of TGEVs. This may be due to the higher PVP coating in the Ag colloids. PVP coatings reduce the free Ag surfaces which responsible for antiviral activity. The significant anti-TGEV action of Ag nanoparticles and Ag nanowires may be due to the direct interaction of Ag NPs and silver nanowires with the TGEV surface protein, including glycoprotein, thereby inhibiting the TGEV infection initiation. Ag nanoparticles and Ag nanowires may modify some TGEV surface proteins' composition and prevent their recognition and binding to the cellular receptor of porcine aminopeptidase.</p><p id="p0290">Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are nanomaterial with outstanding surface functional chemistry, excellent biocompatibility, stability, and zero toxicity. GNPs have been commonly used in human medicine, veterinary medicine, and biology as carriers of antigens and therapeutic agents. Staroverov et al. [<xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] studied the immunological response of guinea pigs following administration of GNP-conjugated transmissible gastroenteritis inactivated virus antigen as a nanocarrier. Spherical gold nanospheres were synthesized by reduction of aqueous tetrachloroauric acid under reflux condition (at 100&#160;&#176;C) followed by the addition of 1% aqueous sodium citrate. The average particle diameter was around 15&#160;nm. Antigen&#8211;gold nanoparticle conjugates were synthesized by simple mixing. According to the results, the immunization of guinea pigs with TGEV antigen&#8211;GNPs induces antigen-presenting cells and increases the splenic lymphoid (antibody-forming) cells' proliferative ability. In addition, &#947;-IFN, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6 levels were higher in animals immunized with antigen-gold nanoparticle conjugates relative to intact animals or in animals administered with antigen alone, suggesting that the GNP-antigen conjugates induce cellular immunity. Similarly, Mezhenny, et al. [<xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] investigated the immunogenicity of TGEV antigen conjugated colloidal gold nanoparticles (CG) against TGEV infection. GNPs were prepared using the redox reaction between chloroauric acid and sodium citrate. The diameter of the circular shaped gold nanoparticles was around 15&#160;nm. Results showed that the TGE virus antigen and CG conjugate stimulates higher interferon and cytokine production levels compared to native antigen immunized in guinea pigs. In addition, the animals immunized with CG conjugate showed antibody titer twice as large as the control group animals. According to the colloidal particles' results, they promote the effective expression of viral peptides on cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.</p><p id="p0295">Adjuvants are biomolecules introduced to vaccines or experimental antigens, which may boost the immune response via a variety of mechanisms. The popular clinically relevant vaccine adjuvants are alum, emulsions, liposomes, and silica. Alum is the adjuvant that has been most widely used since the 1920s. However, several drawbacks are associated with these adjuvants, such as local reactions to injection sites, causing IgE-mediated allergy, and the sensitivity of susceptible individuals. Overcoming these limitations, the development of nanoadjuvants has brought a new perspective to vaccine enhancement. For example, silicon nanoparticles have been used as an antigen carrier for promoting the uptake of co-administered antigens because of their immune compatibility, biocompatibility, particle size tunability, morphology, structure, and surface functionality. Jin et al. [<xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] investigated the immune enhancement of nano silicon adjuvanted TGEV vaccine and compared its results with the alum adjuvant. The purchased nanosilica adjuvant (70&#160;nm) was mixed into the inactivated TGEV vaccine preparation at a ratio of 1:2. The results revealed that, relative to negative controls, the nanoadjuvant provided a significantly higher mucosal immune response in the early immune response. The nano silicon adjuvanted TGEV vaccine significantly enhanced cellular and humoral immunity in mice compared to the alum adjuvant. In addition, nanoparticles have narrow size distribution, greater surface area, and better adhesion that can boost adjuvant action, increase targeted antigen distribution, and significantly minimize side effects. Furthermore, the nano-silicon adjuvanted TGEV vaccine stimulates signaling channels for Toll-like receptors, controls the development and release of multiple inflammatory cytokines, and rapidly triggers the innate and adaptive immune systems to improve the immune response. These findings suggest that nano silicon may be used in the TGEV vaccine as an alternative for alum adjuvant and commercial adjuvant that offers an innovative approach for the development of the vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><label>7</label><title>Application of nanomaterial in the treatment of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</title><p id="p0300">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped single-stranded and positive-sense RNA virus of the genus Alphacoronavirus, Coronaviridae family, and Nidovirales order. PEDV induces large-scale diarrhea infections in pigs and a fatality risk of 80&#8211;100% in suckling piglets. The virus belongs to the genus &#945; of the coronavirus family, which includes TGEV, bat coronavirus, and human coronavirus. Although both PEDV and TGEV infect pigs, PEDV is genetically more closely correlated with bat coronavirus than with TGEV; this leads to the possibility that PEDV might have originated from bats [<xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Apparently, there is no treatment for PEDV available. The existing techniques for controlling viral infectivity are based on identifying agents capable of interfering in particular steps such as viral entry and replication. For example, it was found that homoharringtonine (HHT), a natural compound inhibits the first step of the eukaryotic translation elongation process. HHT antagonizes the degree of endogenous and exogenous phosphorylation (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-eIF4E), which may control the selective translation of particular mRNA. Furthermore, a previous study reported that HHT had completely inhibited PEDV infection in cell cultures at a concentration of 500&#160;nM [<xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>,<xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an autophagy inhibitor, has also shown antiviral efficacy against a wide range of viruses. Hydroxychloroquine therapy at 50&#160;&#956;M and HHT treatment at 150&#160;nM has been reported to minimize the virus titer in TCID<sub>50</sub> (tissue culture infective dose) by 30 and 3.5 fold, respectively, and the combination has decreased the virus titer in TCID<sub>50</sub> by 200 fold [<xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. For disease control, live attenuated or killed vaccines have been introduced all around the world. However, all vaccines did not substantially decrease morbidity and virus shedding. Researchers are therefore working on next-generation PEDV vaccines. Among them, nanomaterial-based formulations, nanoparticle-based vaccine candidates, and nanoparticle-based carriers/delivery systems with various benefits have recently been investigated to treat PDEV.</p><p id="p0305">The effects of metallic NPs have been evaluated against PEDV.

Results demonstrated promising antiviral activity against PEDV infection by 3.0 log reduction of the virus titer at a 12&#160;h post-infection (hpi) noncytotoxic concentration. In addition, the treatment with Ag<sub>2</sub>S nanoclusters prevents negative-strand RNA synthesis and viral budding. Moreover, the study reported that Ag<sub>2</sub>S nanoclusters triggered the IFN-stimulating gene development and Vero cell proinflammatory cytokine expression that could inhibit PEDV infection.</p><p id="p0310">Though many metallic nanoparticles have shown excellent antiviral therapies, there are many reported metallic nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity cases in human cells.

The average size of CCM-CDs was 1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;nm. CCM-CDs (125&#160;&#956;g/ml) inhibited virus entry by more than 50%. According to zeta potential studies, positive charge CCM-CDs have been shown to induce viral accumulation by electrostatic interactions, which results in decreased viral infectivity. Raman spectral analysis indicated that the viral protein structure has been altered by the incorporation of CCM-CDs. Furthermore, CCM-CDs showed inhibitory activity on negative-strand RNA synthesis, indicating that at the replication stage, CCM-CDs would effectively inhibit PEDV. CCM-CDs showed innate antiviral immunity by inducing the expressions of ISGs and proinflammatory cytokines. Finally, CCM-CDs could inhibit reactive oxygen species generation (ROS) (ROS can damage DNA by regulating apoptotic signaling pathways) induced by PEDV infection.</p><p id="p0315">Biodegradable and biocompatible PLGA NPs have been used as a vaccine delivery system facilitated by particulate matter.

PLGA-KAg was prepared using a standard double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. PLGA was dissolved in solvent dichloromethane, in which PEDV antigens were solubilized earlier. The solution was then homogenized and added to the 10% polyvinyl alcohol aqueous solution. After that, the formulation has been stirred, and nanoparticles have been washed and freeze-dried. In pregnant sows immunized with PLGA-KAg, PEDV-specific IgG and IgA specific antibody titers were enhanced in contrast with sows immunized with KAg. The passively immunized suckling piglets of those sows demonstrated similar outcomes. In pregnant sows vaccinated with PLGA-KAg, IFN-&#947; levels were induced in comparison to those vaccinated with KAg or emulsified killed PEDV, and lymphocyte proliferation responses were enhanced. Notably, the group vaccinated with PLGA-KAg had less piglet mortality than those vaccinated with KAg or emulsified killed PEDV.

Feline coronaviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses with a non-segmented genome of approximately 30&#160;kb and 11 putative open-reading frames. Feline coronaviruses exist as two distinct biotypes. They are feline infectious peritonitis virus and feline enteric virus [<xref rid="bib126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. The feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) biotype is prevalent, usually infecting the gut of cats and is normally disease-free, whereas the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) biotype is accountable for lethal systemic illness. In comparison, feline coronavirus also occurs as two serotypes: Feline coronavirus type I (FECV type I and FIPV type I) and: Feline coronavirus type II (FECV type II and FIPV type II). Both FIPV and FECV are represented within both feline coronavirus serotypes I and II [<xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Serological and genetic surveys have shown that the Type I feline coronavirus dominates in the world. FIP is one of Felidae's most devastating and deadly virus infections, not because of the high death rate but due to the lack of adequate diagnosis, prevention, and therapeutic options. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is further complicating the condition, which may worsen disease symptoms. Different vaccinations have been tested to prevent FIP, such as live virulence-attenuated or inactivated FIPV vaccine, but no vaccination has had an adequate impact. Those vaccinations instead enhanced the onset of FIP; in fact, the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies promoted the infection with FIP [<xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. DNA vaccinations were unable to induce cell-mediated immunity against the FIPV, and the vaccines coadministered with interleukin-(IL-)12 yielded adverse effects in cats. In addition, the therapeutic efficiencies of different antiviral agents and immunomodulatory medicines against FIPV have been studied in previous studies, but most were to avail. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that itraconazole, a common antifungal drug, GC376 3C-like protease inhibitor, and nucleoside analogue GS-441524, are effective in inhibiting infection in cats with naturally occurring FIP [<xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>].</p><p id="p0325">Among various attempts that have been taken to treat FIP, nanomaterials have gained considerable attention as nanodrug carriers or as antiviral agents. For example, Hu, et al.

). The biocompatible PEG-PLGA block-copolymer provides a hydrophobic core for the transport and delivery of hydrophobic diphyllin that offers solutions for compound's insolubility without organic solvents. Furthermore, intracellular ingestion of nanoparticles through the typical endocytosis process may boost the efficacy of diphyllin by promoting colocalization of the compound with an endosomal V-ATPase, thereby decreasing the off-target impact of the product and improving its antiviral activity. Nanoparticles were prepared by dissolving diphyllin in chloroform with PEG-PLGA. After that, the mixture was transferred to deionized water and then probe sonicated. Finally, the chloroform was evaporated by placing the mixture in a fume hood. The average particle diameter of the diphylin-loaded nanoparticle was 36.19&#160;&#177;&#160;1.15&#160;nm. The nanoparticles have significantly enhanced the protection and effectiveness of diphyllin and have raised the therapeutic index in the investigated infection model by approximately 800. With nanoformulation, diphyllin nanoparticles showed a 13-fold decrease in cellular toxicity. In comparison, diphyllin NPs showed a 60-fold increase in antiviral activity relative to the free drug.

It provides an excellent opportunity for the improved mode of action of prevailing medicinal drugs. Also, nanoscience offers an excellent platform for developing modern nano-therapeutics and diagnostics, which are urgently required in the era of drug resistance. Nanoparticles/nanocarriers or nanovaccinations can be effectively designed by functionalizing the nanostructures with proper functional groups to incorporate conventional antiviral features into those modifications. Such modifications involve characteristics of advanced nanosystems with increased surface area to volume ratio to ensure large drug payloads, the ability to attach molecular targets to improve the specificity of desirable cell types, tissues or other compartments, improved pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and solubility properties providing greater accumulation, controlled and sustained release, the ability to adjust the surface charge to promote the entrance of cells across the negatively charged cellular membrane [<xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>].</p><p id="p0350">Furthermore, nanoparticles can be designed as non-invasive and sustained delivery vaccine antigen carriers to a particular site. It will facilitate the development of single-dose vaccination formulations. E.g., Intranasal application of the nano vaccine against influenza [<xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], chitosan nanoparticles incorporated with hemagglutinin protein of H1N1 influenza virus [<xref rid="bib134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>], streptococcus equi proteins [<xref rid="bib135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>], and surface antigen (pRc/CMV-HBs) of hepatitis B virus [<xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>].</p><p id="p0355">Virus-like particle technology is a very effective vaccine delivery technology that helps to mimic the features of the virus in vaccine applications. Since they do not hold any genetic material, VLPs resemble the conformation of native viruses without being viral. Due to their high curvature radii, synthetic nanoparticles often have high surface energies that facilitate the adsorption of biomolecules, such as protein, in a process called protein corona formation. While the formulation of protein corona is of growing scientific importance due to its implications for biomedical applications, synthetic VLPs formed by protein corona formation allow successful vaccination [<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Vaccines based on nanoparticles are supposed to boost the vaccine effectiveness, immunization strategies, and targeted delivery to enhance immune responses. Among various types of nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles seem to be the preferred nanomaterial for immunotherapy applications since their physicochemical characteristics prevent the development of antibodies toward platform material. Furthermore, several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that gold nanoparticles stimulate different immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, leading to the development of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL&#8208;1&#946; and TNF&#8208;&#945;) and Th1 cytokines (IFN&#8208;&#255; and IL&#8208;2) [<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In vaccine systems, one of the essential features of the usage of NPs is that they can distribute proteins/peptides to individual tissue cells to assist them in producing an effective immune response. In addition, the use of NPs enhances the uptake of antigen, shields the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation, regulates the antigen release, and makes it safe for human consumption [<xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>].</p><p id="p0360">The ongoing challenge of integrating NPs in biomedical applications is their possible toxicity. Certain materials that are usually considered harmless may become toxic when consumed as nanoparticulate form. For example, titanium dioxide is biologically inert in its naturally occurring mineral form, but it induces inflammatory responses in humans and animals when delivered as NPs smaller than 20&#160;nm in diameter [<xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Likewise, gold is also widely accepted as a secure, inert carrier and is commonly seen in medical implants. However, gold nanoparticles of 1.4&#160;nm in diameter have been shown to penetrate the cells and the nuclear membranes and are irreversibly attached to major DNA grooves, which result in instability. On the other hand, gold NPs with a relatively higher diameter (15&#160;nm) are non-toxic even at a higher concentration of up to 60-fold [<xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>].</p><p id="p0365">Other NP-related toxicity concerns involve accumulation in cells, primarily due to prolonged exposure or long-term usage. For example, fluorescent quantum dots were detected in mice 2 years after injection [<xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. In general, the approaches used to detect NP trafficking in cells are mostly based on pharmacological inhibitors or mutant cell lines. The concern with these analyses is that these techniques are not unique to one trafficking mechanism, and therefore findings may also be challenging to interpret or even contradict other literature. For example, while Rejman et al. [<xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] reported that the treatment of B16&#160;cells with chlorpromazine strongly decreased the absorption of 50&#160;nm size negatively charged polystyrene NPs compared with 200&#160;nm size NPs, Dos Santos et al. [<xref rid="bib141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] showed a contrary finding [<xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>,<xref rid="bib141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Therefore, it is ideal to obtain a combination of different inhibitors and mutant cell lines with carefully chosen controls.</p><p id="p0370">Indeed, these nanoparticles play a major role as nanocarriers or nanovaccines in the treatment of viral infections; for certain viruses, such as SARS-CoVs, respiratory syncytial virus, and HIV/AIDS, diagnosis, safe and effective therapeutics are vital need. Today, three pathogenic viruses are present, notably MERS- and SARS-CoVs, and SARS-CoV-2 are the major outbreaks. Attributed to the prevalence of COVID-19, it is also important to discuss several details concerning virulence, pathogenesis, and the actual cause or mode of transmission of viral infections; such recommendations and potential alternatives for further studies, in particular on SARS-CoV-2, are including:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0015"><list-item id="u0035"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="p0375">The influence of metallic NPs (for example, silver, gold, and copper NPs or hybrid NPs) can be assessed against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies are suggesting the use of silver nanoparticles to treat COVID-19 at an early stage through inhalation. As a first-line treatment to inhibit the progression of the disease, a model and computation method for generating antiviral minimum inhibitory concentrations of silver particles in various respiratory system locations was proposed [<xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Besides the metal nanoparticles, bionanoparticles (e.g., nanocelluloses) carrying synthetic antiviral drugs or herbal antiviral drugs (e.g., curcumin) can also be suggested to treat COVID-19 at an early stage through inhalation.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0040"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="p0380">Designing a noninvasive nanoparticle vaccine delivery system by targeting vaccine antigens to provide antigen-specific mucosal immunity can be used as an important approach to treat COVID-19. The respiratory tract holds a subset of local dendritic cells, which regularly sample and process innocuous agents. Therefore, dendritic cells of the respiratory tract could act as an ideal target for the absorption of specific NPs delivered along a non-invasive route to treat COVID-19. In previous studies, Raghuwanshi, et al. [<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] developed a successful approach for enhancing the immunogenicity of low-dose DNA vaccine through targeted delivery to nasal resident dendritic cells. This vaccine approach provides a new insight for non-invasive ways of targeting vaccine antigens to dendritic cells.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0045"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="p0385">Though there are many COVID-19 vaccines that have been produced all around the world; still, tens of thousands of people will need to be enrolled to confirm the effectiveness and to look for long-term side effects. Among several approaches to designing vaccines, one concern is that some vaccines can protect against disease but not against infection (the ability of the virus to get into the body). For example, there are many concerns regarding the usage of live attenuated vaccines, including reversion of virulence, recombination with virulent field strains, minor tissue injuries which may develop into severe secondary infections [<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. One of the latest developments in vaccine preparation, like virus-like particles, provides superior immune response capability that has led to synthetic nanomaterials to emulate viral features for vaccine development. The use of bionanoparticles in preparation of VLP provides a more effective approach concerning safety and biocompatibility [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this regard, nanocellulose produced by acid hydrolysis can be suggested for the preparation of VLP in vaccination against COVID 19 as they carry negative surface charges and the available hydroxyl groups provide the potential of enzyme/protein immobilization (protein corona formation) and incorporation of adjuvants on the basis of its chemical conjunction and electrostatic adsorption [<xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">[142]</xref>, <xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">[143]</xref>, <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">[144]</xref>, <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">[145]</xref>, <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">[146]</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item id="u0050"><label>&#8226;</label><p id="p0390">The adjuvants are biomolecules introduced to vaccines through a number of pathways to enhance the immune response.

In addition, the surface-operated carbon nanodots could serve as entry inhibitors by interfering with the virus at the early stage of viral infection. Furthermore, carbon dots (CDs) have been shown to inhibit viral replication by positively regulating the antiviral type I interferon signaling. In addition, carbon nanotubes have also been proposed as carriers for antiviral agents in previous literature.

Nano-based formulation approaches such as novel nanovaccine transfer platforms, delivery carriers, and nanodrugs have been developed against previously known coronaviruses. Nano-based approaches have been successfully used to deliver both antigens and adjuvants in a virus-like manner, prevent viral antigen agglomeration, and for prime-boost immunization, improving the immune response against MERS-CoV. It was observed that high surface energies of nanoparticles improved the antigen corona formation, and bionanoparticles enhanced the inactivated viral encapsulation in IBV vaccines. Due to the insufficient protection of inactivated viral vaccines against SARS-CoV, the plasmid DNA loaded nanoparticles, and immunostimulant/nanoparticle complexes have been developed to provoke the mucosal immune response. Furthermore, instead of using full-length S protein, the usage of SARS-CoV protein receptor-binding domains triggered the most promising neutralizing antibodies. There are about 283 candidate vaccines have been developed to provoke the immune response against SARS-CoV 2. Some SARS-CoV 2 vaccines use nanoencapsulation of viral proteins/RNA to prevent degradation of their genetic cargo. Ag nanoparticles with stabilizers have shown anti-TGEV action. Also, Ag2S nanoclusters have been used to prevent PEDV RNA synthesis and budding. In addition, Ag nanoparticles were suggested as inhalable nanotherapeutics against SARS-CoV 2. Furthermore, Au nanoparticles are a good candidate for antigen conjugation due to their stability, biocompatibility and surface functional chemistry. The use of non-metallic nanoparticles such as CCM-CDs and PLGA have shown excellent antiviral therapies against PEDV. CCM-CDs have shown inhibitory activity on negative-strand RNA synthesis. PLGA prevents the trapped vaccine from protease degradation. The development of nanoadjuvants has overcome the limitations of common vaccine adjuvants. The use of nanocarriers for antiviral drug delivery has shown excellent antiviral efficiencies compared to the free drug (e.g., diphyllin loaded PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and Cur-CS nanoparticles against FIPV). Indeed, these nanoparticles play a significant role in nanocarriers or nanovaccines; there are some concerns over the use of nanoparticles in biomedical applications, such as toxicity issues of some forms of nanoparticles and accumulation in cells.</p><p id="p0405">In order to improve the identified existing therapeutic limitations, these nano-based systems have demonstrated versatile features. According to the studies mentioned above, researchers carried out high-level scientific investigations to discover novel and intelligent nano-based materials and matrices to design nanoformulations of antiviral drugs and nanovaccines for viral diseases, especially for the infections caused by human and animal coronaviruses. Various incidents of epidemics and pandemics have led to many causalities in the history of civilization. However, in the meantime, the use of smart and advanced technologies, particularly the field of evolving nanotechnologies, could have a significant influence on handling prevalent and potential outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0410">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Mourya</surname><given-names>D.T.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>P.D.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Ullas</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Bhardwaj</surname><given-names>S.D.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Sahay</surname><given-names>R.R.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Chadha</surname><given-names>M.S.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Shete</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Jadhav</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Gangakhedkar</surname><given-names>R.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Emerging/re-emerging viral diseases &amp; new viruses on the Indian horizon</article-title><source>Indian J.
