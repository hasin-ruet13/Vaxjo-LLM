Polymeric NPs based on chitosan (CS) can act as excellent drug carriers because of some intrinsic beneficial properties including biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, bioactivity, easy preparation, and targeting specificity. Drug transport and release from CS-based particulate systems depend on the extent of cross-linking, morphology, size, and density of the particulate system, as well as physicochemical properties of the drug. All these aspects have to be considered when developing new CS-based NPs as potential drug delivery systems. This comprehensive review is summarizing and discussing recent advances in CS-based NPs being developed and examined for drug delivery. From this point of view, an enhancement of CS properties by its modification is presented. An enhancement in drug delivery by CS NPs is discussed in detail focusing on (i) a brief summarization of basic characteristics of CS NPs, (ii) a categorization of preparation procedures used for CS NPs involving also recent improvements in production schemes of conventional as well as novel CS NPs, (iii) a categorization and evaluation of CS-based-nanocomposites involving their production schemes with organic polymers and inorganic material, and (iv) very recent implementations of CS NPs and nanocomposites in drug delivery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chitosan</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>drug delivery</kwd><kwd>new formulations</kwd><kwd>targeting</kwd><kwd>controlled release</kwd><kwd>derivatives</kwd><kwd>nanocomposites</kwd><kwd>preparation schemes</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-22-09652"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Chitosan (CS) is one of the most exploited polymers in biomedical science, and it is the second most abundant next to cellulose, a naturally occurring amino polysaccharide [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is produced from chitin (present in the exoskeleton of insects and marine aquatic animals, and microorganisms such as fungi, yeast, and microalgae) by partial deacetylation in an alkaline environment [<xref rid="B2-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Structurally, chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed &#946;-(1&#8594;4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Depending on the source and preparation procedures the molecular weight of CS ranges from 300 to 1000 kD with 30&#8211;90% of deacetylation degree, DD [<xref rid="B2-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The amino group in CS has a p<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>a</sub> value of ca. 6.5, which leads to significant protonation in neutral solutions. These basic parameters (i.e., MW, DD, p<italic toggle="yes">K</italic><sub>a</sub>) determine chitosan properties and action in biological systems.</p><p>Chitosan offers outstanding chemical and biological properties due to which it has gained enormous importance in various applications in pharmaceutical and biomedical areas, e.g., in drug delivery, gene delivery, tissue engineering, etc. The polycationic nature of CS makes it water-soluble and a bioadhesive that readily binds to negatively charged surfaces such as mucosal membranes. Thereby it increases the adhesion to the mucosa and as a result, enhances the time of contact for penetration of drug molecules through it [<xref rid="B5-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Complexing properties of CS can be utilized in anionic drug delivery systems including low molecular drugs as well as polyanionic biomolecules such as DNA or siRNA [<xref rid="B7-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Its carrier ability is increased with its charge so that it can serve as a pH-dependent drug carrier [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mechanism responsible for the permeation enhancing effect of CS is also based on the positive charges of polymer, which seems to interact with the cell membrane resulting in a structural reorganization (opening) of tight junctions-associated proteins. Thus, CS of a high degree of deacetylation and high molecular mass exhibits the comparatively highest increase in epithelial permeability, and, by that, enhances the transport of polar drugs across epithelial surfaces [<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity due to its chemical and structural similarity to the natural glycosaminoglycans. Chitosan is easily biodegraded into harmless products (amino sugars) that are absorbed completely in the body. Besides this, it is hemostatic, fungistatic, bacteriostatic, spermicidal, anticholesteric, and anticancerogenic [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is worthy to mention also efflux pump inhibitory properties of CS. Here, CS inhibits certain transporter proteins on the membrane of intestinal epithelial cells or enterocytes, which pump out xenobiotics, mostly drugs, making these transporters one of the major components of drug resistance mechanisms [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>CS properties and action in biological systems can be modified via proper physical and chemical modification of its chemical structure. Changes in its MW, DD, crosslinking, covalently bound functional groups and moieties, coordinated anions or polyanions, etc. can be advantageously utilized in various practical areas where CS is implemented. For example, introducing small chemical groups to the CS structure, such as alkyl (hydroxypropyl- or carboxymethyl groups can dramatically increase the solubility of CS [<xref rid="B17-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Cationic property can be reversed via sulfonation to introduce an anionic character with water-soluble, better paste fluidity, high water reducing ratio, and anticoagulant property [<xref rid="B18-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mechanical strength of the particles increases in an increase in crosslinking of CS (e.g., with anions, dextran, sulfate, glyoxal, genipin, tripolyphosphate, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde). Highly cross-linked particles show less swelling, less inside water penetration, and outside drug diffusion. Crosslinking can slow down drug release and prevent burst release [<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mucoadhesive properties can be improved by trimethylation of the primary amino groups of CS and PEG-ylation or immobilization of thiol groups on CS interacting with the cysteine-rich region of the mucous glycoprotein. Mucoadhesion can be improved also by the formation of complexes with multivalent anionic drugs, excipients, and multivalent inorganic anions [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A glutaraldehyde cross-linking of CS enhances an ability to quickly form hydrogel without the use of any acute harmful chemical [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In situ gelling properties of CS can be improved by thiolation [<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thiolation enhances the permeation effect even more up to 30 times in some cases; trimethyl chitosan (TMC) is soluble at all pH and it was also found to reduce the trans-epithelial electrical resistance by 25&#8211;85%. TMC is a great permeation enhancer as it was found to open tight junctions. It also increases the paracellular transport of the drugs [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, a great emphasis is laid on the development of various CS derivatives as has been documented by several recent review papers. Negm et al. [<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Tian et al. [<xref rid="B20-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] presented advancements on modification of CS biopolymer and potential applications of new CS derivatives. Mateescu et al. [<xref rid="B21-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reviewed the self-assembled systems based on CS derivatives for drug delivery. Other authors focused on the specific CS derivatives in their review papers. Among them, Fonseca-Santos et al. [<xref rid="B22-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] discussed carboxymethylated derivatives of CS and their use as biomaterials and DDS. Dimassi et al. [<xref rid="B23-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] discussed sulfonated and sulfated derivatives of CS for biomedical applications, and Tekade et al. [<xref rid="B24-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] dealt with thiolated CS derivatives as the novel mucoadhesive polymers for better-targeted drug delivery.</p><p>Chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs), reflecting properties of native or chemically modified CS polymers, can further and significantly spread the application possibilities of CS. The preparation of CS NPs is often conducted in mild conditions as CS is soluble in acidic aqueous solutions at room temperature, no toxic organic solvents or heat is required. A broad category of drugs can be incorporated into CS drug delivery systems (DDS), including small molecules, proteins, and polynucleotides. CS can release the encapsulated drug in a controlled fashion. The free amine groups on CS also provide ionic crosslinking ability [<xref rid="B25-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, the general importance of &#8220;chitosan nanoparticles&#8221; is documented by ca. 1500 papers registered under this keyword in the WoS database in the first half of 2021. This review aims to summarize comprehensively knowledge coming from the recent review as well as research papers devoted to all aspects of CS NPs intended for drug delivery. Because of the plethora of relevant papers, proper classification, and organization of particular information in individual sections of this review is a prerequisite for an easy orientation in such extensive material. Based on this principle, we discussed all aspects related to the development of new CS NPs and nanocomposites (involving the most important CS modifications and production schemes of conventional as well as novel CS NPs and nanocomposites, employing various advanced organic as well as inorganic materials) and evaluated the developed systems in term of drug delivery enhancement. In this context, we evaluated very recent implementations of CS NPs and nanocomposites in oral, ocular, nasal, pulmonary, buccal, periodontal, vaginal, dermal, and transdermal drug delivery, and wound healing, but also vaccine and gene delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-22-09652"><title>2. Enhancement of Chitosan Properties by Its Modification</title><p>Although CS possesses many functional properties, it has several limitations such as high hydrophilicity, low ductility, a high degree of swelling and it is thermally less stable [<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A major limiting factor in its utilization is poor solubility. CS is insoluble at physiological pH (pH 7.4) and ineffective as an absorption enhancer which interferes with its biomedical application. Improving the solubility of CS is a crucial factor for judicious use of the multitude of applications.</p><p>Chemical derivatives of CS can overcome limitations of unmodified CS and have received increasing interest over the past decade due to their advocated chemical, biological, and functional advantages over unmodified CS concerning their solubility, gelling properties, design of hydrophobic derivatives with amphiphilic character, and capacity to harness self-assembling nanostructures and chemical conjugates with an assortment of bioactive and therapeutic molecules. Other noteworthy benefits include improved biocompatibility and enhanced properties for complexing biomolecules (e.g., DNA, RNA). Varieties of CS derivatives have been developed throughout these years depending upon the requirements for various applications in biomedical areas [<xref rid="B9-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most used derivatives in the current pharmaceutical industry are made by quaternization, acylation, thiolation, and carboxymethylation [<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Due to a variety of substituents of different nature, various derivatization procedures, and different activity and/or use of the products, it can be quite difficult to define criteria for specific groups of CS derivatives unambiguously. Although some aspects can overlap in particular groups, a specification of the basic categories should simplify orientation in produced CS derivatives. Negm et al. [<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] divided CS modifications into the following categories: (i) substituted CS derivatives such as (I) thiolated CS, (II) phosphorylated CS, and (III) phtaloylated CS, (ii) cross-linked CS derivatives, such as (I) CS-glutaraldehyde cross-linked polymers, (II) EDTA CS polymer, and (III) CS-epichlorohydrin crosslinked polymers, (iii) carboxylic acid CS derivatives such as (I) CS carboxyalkylate derivatives, (II) CS methacrylate derivatives and (III) CS benzoylate derivatives, (iv) ionic CS derivatives such as (I) cationic CS derivatives and (II) sulphated CS derivatives and (v) bounded CS to specific molecules such as cyclodextrin linked CS. Bakshi et al. [<xref rid="B13-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] presented the scheme highlighting (i) chemical modifications on -NH2 of glucosamine or on -OH groups of the polymer (such as (I) alkylation, acylation, hydroalkylation, carboxyalkylation, azidation, thiolation, (II) sugar derivatives, CS dendrimer hybrid, cyclodextrin linked, crown ether bonding, (III) metal ion chelates, grafting, cross-linking) and (ii) enzymatic modifications (using tyrosinase or chlorogenic acid). In their scheme following types of CS derivatives were included: hydroxyalkyl, acyl, N-alkylated, amphiphilic, thiolated, succinyl, cyclodextrin linked, quaternary ammonium derivative, enzymatic graft, crown ether bound, sialo dendrimer hybrid, PEGylated, galactosylated derivatives. In this review, we divided CS derivatives into six groups, according to the character of substituent/derivative, namely hydrophobic, amphiphilic, ionic derivatives, derivatives with specific substituents (sugar bound CS derivatives, CS derivatives with cyclic structures, CS derivatives with thiol groups, thiosemicarbazone linked CS derivatives), CS copolymers, and cross-linked CS derivatives. Wang et al. [<xref rid="B26-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] summarized basic synthetic strategies and properties of CS derivatives in their review. They discussed particular CS structural modifications with respect to their biological activities and applications. In the following subsections, particular groups of derivatives, as they are listed in <xref rid="ijms-22-09652-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, are briefly discussed in terms of their modified properties, main functions, and utilization.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-22-09652"><title>2.1. Hydrophobic Chitosan Derivatives (with Hydrophobic Substituents)</title><p>Alkylated CS. Generally, alkyl CS derivatives are obtained by reductive amination of CS. Short alkyl chain (C5) has almost no influence on the rigidity and the interaction properties of modified CS, whereas longer chains promote progressively more efficient hydrophobic interactions and intraaggregation of the polymer. However, the effect can be important if the basicity of the amino groups is altered. The hydrophobic character of alkylated CS increases with increasing chains length from C6 to C12. Moreover, the degree of substitution (DS) is an essential parameter in the formation of hydrophobic domains by alkyl-alkyl interactions [<xref rid="B21-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recently Burr et al. [<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] used two methods to alkylate high MW CS with glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (GTAC) to produce CS derivatives that are water-soluble throughout the pH range. In addition, a novel CS derivative was created by alkylating one of the products with the GTAC analog Quab 342 containing C12 alkyl chains. The study of phase behavior and rheological characteristics of the CS derivatives in the presence of anionic surfactant showed that the derivatives form soluble complexes at low and high SDS concentrations and that the Quab 342 derivative was able to form gels.</p><p>Acylated CS. Acylation is more versatile than alkylation as it allows (depending on reaction conditions) the introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the amino (N-acylation to form an amide), hydroxyl (O-acylation to form an ester), or both residues. The acylation of CS requires the use of organic acid derivatives (such as anhydrides, acid halides, etc.) as acylating agents in a proper reaction medium. The amino group of CS is more active than the hydroxyl group, so the acylation reaction generally occurs preferentially on the amino group. The amino group in CS could be protected before acylation, and then the protecting group could be removed to obtain only O-acylated CS [<xref rid="B26-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The introduction of a hydrophobic moiety with an ester linkage increases its potential for biodegradability by lipase-like enzymes [<xref rid="B13-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Acylated CS was proposed as an excipient for drug formulation, essentially because of their hydrophobic association that can enhance the stability of the matrices and can favor nanoparticle self-assembly [<xref rid="B21-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. N-acylated CS with saturated (C8&#8211;C18) and unsaturated (e.g., oleic, linoleic, elaidoic, and erucoyl) acyl groups of different chain lengths have been successfully synthesized. The degree of substitution was easily controlled by adjusting the number of fatty acids. After being grafted on the CS chain, the fatty chains increased the hydrophobicity and changed the structural features of the copolymer, which tended to self-assemble driven by hydrophobic forces [<xref rid="B20-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, Nanda et al. [<xref rid="B29-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] developed an acylated CS (myristoyl and octanoyl) coated paclitaxel-loaded liposomal formulation to overcome the cremophor EL related toxicities. Slower drug release was observed in the case of liposomes coated with acylated CS as compared to uncoated and native CS-coated liposomes. All liposomal formulations were found less cytotoxic than paclitaxel injection (Celtax&#8482;, Celon Labs, India). In vitro cell uptake and intracellular distribution studies confirmed the cytosolic delivery of uncoated and coated liposomes. The myristoyl CS coated liposomal system exhibited better pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, and tumor uptake characteristics than other formulations. These results suggested the potential application of acylated CS coated liposomal delivery systems in tumor targeting.</p><p>N-phthaloylated CS. CS polymer is poorly soluble in organic solvents, while N-phthaloylation of CS is efficient for solubilization. N-phthaloyl CS derivatives have higher reactivity than N,O-phthaloylated CS derivatives. Completely deacetylated CS polymer reacted by phthalic anhydride yields N-phthaloyl CS derivative which has a high solubility in polar-organic solvents [<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Permadi et al. [<xref rid="B30-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] acylated a CS protected with phthalic anhydride (N-phtaloylated CS) and unprotected CS (without phthalic anhydride) via acylation on both primary hydroxyl and amine groups on the backbone of CS. This chemically modified CS was proposed to enhance the drug solubilization as well as improving biocompatibility and degradability.</p><p>Benzoylated CS.

Ionic Chitosan Derivatives (with Cationic and Anionic Substituents)</title><p>Quarternary ammonium CS derivatives. The cationic nature of the CS is essential during several applications such as absorption enhancement, bio-adhesion, and transfection efficiency as well as to biological activities such as anti-tumor, and antihypercholesterolemic effect. Highly cationic derivatives of CS (including N,N,N-trimethyl CS chloride, TMC, as one of the most popular) were prepared by reaction of CS and an alkylhalogenide at an elevated temperature in a strongly alkaline environment to neutralize the acid being generated during the reaction and to avoid protonation of the unreacted primary amino groups [<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The degree of quaternization (DQ) depends on the number of reaction steps, the reaction time, and the deacetylation levels of CS. The water solubility of TMC can be tailored according to DQ. With a suitable DQ, TMC can be dissolved in neutral and alkaline environments. Mucoadhesive properties are enhanced by increasing the cationic character of the CS due to the interaction with anionic groups of mucin. TMC has improved mucoadhesive property and absorption enhancement due to the stronger positive charge [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has been shown that a 40&#8211;60% degree of quaternization has the best absorption-enhancing properties. Further increase in the DQ does not have a significant effect on absorption and shows increased toxicity. By quaternizing CS, thermosensitive hydrogels have been formed (e.g., for nasal drug delivery) [<xref rid="B20-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

CS sulfates have been shown to possess anticoagulant and hemagglutination inhibition activities due to the structural similarity to heparin apart from its antisclerotic, antiviral, anti-HIV, antibacterial, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibition activities. They also have high sorption capacities and are used in metal ion recovery. Sulfur compounds are grafted onto CS for recovery of mercury and the uptake of precious metals.

Rif-CuS/CS NPs showed superior bactericidal activity (2.4&#8211;2.7-fold) within 4 h when compared to free drug Rifampicin (1.6-fold) and suppressed the pro-inflammatory gene (TNF-&#945; by 3.66 &#177; 0.19-fold). d-PIN-RIF-CuS/CS NPs increased expression of the anti-inflammatory gene (IL-10 by 13.09 &#177; 0.47-fold) and also the expression of the TGF-&#946;1 gene (13.00 &#177; 0.19-fold).

In vitro, the cell culture results showed that the membrane functionalized by CS derivative could promote the proliferation of MC3T3-E1s and enhance the osteogenic differentiation by up-regulating the expression level of osteogenic genes compared to the PDLLA and P1/PDOPA membranes. Especially, when the outermost layer was SCS, the effect of promoting cell proliferation was better than that of PCS. However, for osteogenic differentiation, PCS had better quantitative experimental results than SCS.

The sulfur groups on thiolated CS can form disulfide bonding with cysteine-rich areas on mucin glycoprotein, therefore such derivatives have significantly improved mucoadhesion. Another mechanism of mucoadhesion of thiolated CS derivatives is in situ crosslinking property between the polymers. During the interpenetration process, disulfide bonds are formed within the thiolated CS, which results in anchors chaining up to the mucus gel layer. Due to their in situ gelling properties, a liquid thiolated CS cell suspension can be poured into a mold of the desired shape of the scaffold or can be directly injected at the site of tissue damage. This in situ gelling property is particularly suitable for liquid or semisolid vaginal, nasal, and ocular formulations. The thiolated CS compounds were promising as drug carriers and efficient as nano-medicine for enhancing ocular bioavailability. Thiolated CS enhances permeation by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is responsible for dephosphorylation or phosphorylation of tyrosine subunit occluding that leads to the closing or opening of the tight junctions.

Although 10&#8211;20 nm particles can be widely distributed in various organs through tight endothelial connections, they will also be rapidly excreted by glomeruli [<xref rid="B58-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Smaller particles, having a more curved surface than larger ones, cannot usually obtain the optimal geometry of the activated complement system, and therefore they are unlikely to be absorbed by macrophages contributing to their long circulation time in the blood. Particles larger than 200 nm can be quickly engulfed by the mononuclear phagocytic system and cumulate in the liver and spleen [<xref rid="B59-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Thus, it can be concluded that NPs with small sizes are beneficial for long circulation and distributions in different tissues (in most cases). However, it has to be realized that the particle size should not be as small as possible because too small particles will lead to increased instability of the nanosystem under physiological conditions and will not achieve the expected effect [<xref rid="B57-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. </p><p>The shape is another important basic parameter of NPs affecting and determining their biological processes in vivo. Phagocytosis of NPs by macrophages is the first obstacle faced by NPs in blood circulation, thus phagocytosis of macrophages is strongly shape-dependent [<xref rid="B59-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The shapes of NPs can affect both their adhesion and internalization [<xref rid="B60-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In addition to affecting the blood circulation time, in certain cases, the particle shape can also affect its in vivo distribution. Non-spherical nanocarriers (rod, ellipse, cylinder, ring, star, and other complex shapes) may have a profound impact on the transmission of the vasculature and may then affect their distributions [<xref rid="B60-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In summary, although most of the NPs that have currently been studied are spherical, the unique properties of non-spherical NPs may have a significant effect on circulation and distribution [<xref rid="B55-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Surface hydrophobicity and charge also belong to basic parameters of NPs affecting their biological processes in vivo. Hydrophilic nanomaterials can reduce the RES (reticular endothelial system) effect of NPs, whereas hydrophobic ones can improve the penetration effects of NPs. Hence, it seems to be reasonable to combine the two types of materials in the design of NPs at a certain proportion to allow for the best residence in vivo and optimal targeting to the disease sites. The surface charge may affect the adsorption of some specific molecules (e.g., opsonins), thus causing nanocarriers to be recognized, phagocytosed, and eliminated by macrophages, which can then further affect their transport and fate in the body [<xref rid="B62-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>In the area of nanomedicine, the targeting effect of nanocarriers reflects in increasing the accumulation of particles at disease sites [<xref rid="B64-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Compared with passive targeting (size, shape, surface charge, and hydrophobicity) of NPs, active targeting (modified by ligands) can more actively and effectively transfer NPs to the target site. Furthermore, the modification of targeting ligands can also reduce the clearance of NPs. Hence, modification of NPs with ligands based on the characteristics of the disease site can be considered as one of the major future research directions for nanocarriers targeting [<xref rid="B55-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>NPs can be classified into two major groups based on their morphology: (i) nanospheres and (ii) nanocapsules. Nanospheres represent solid structures with a homogeneous matrix structure in which resources are distributed uniformly, while nanocapsules create a traditional hollow shell structure consisting of a polymer membrane and an internal core of the included drug [<xref rid="B54-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The different structures of polymeric micro- or nanocapsule and micro- or nanoparticle drug delivery systems are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Both materials are the main target of the inclusion of active substances, have a high carrying capacity, and provide controlled release.</p><p>The advanced nano drugs are more suitable than the conventional medicines or microdrugs in terms of site-specific target capabilities, sustained and controlled release, increased absorption rate and bioavailability, and improved stability of therapeutic agents. The NP size, hydrophobicity, modified surface, high surface to volume ratio, and surface charge are the essential factors that control the targeting capabilities. These properties also help in reducing the required drug dose and frequency of administration leading to reduced toxicity and side effects of the chemotherapy drugs and thus improving patient compliance. Currently, polymers are being widely used for pharmaceutical applications ranging from general to highly complex DDS. The polymeric NPs are considered more advanced than simple NPs due to their capability towards prolonged release with improved drug safety and adjustable pharmacokinetics [<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Drugs can be easily attached to nanocarriers either by adsorption or covalent linkage. Drug loading in nanoparticulate systems can be carried out by two methods, (i) during the preparation of particles (incorporation) and (ii) after the formation of particles (incubation). In these systems, a drug is physically embedded into the matrix or adsorbed onto the surface. The efficiency of loading largely depends upon the method of preparation of NPs as well as the physicochemical properties of the drug. Although maximum drug loading can be achieved by incorporating the drug during the formation of particles, it may get affected by the process parameters such as the method of preparation, presence of additives, etc. [<xref rid="B53-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The drug release mechanism from the polymeric NPs is controlled by the degradation rate of polymer and diffusion of the drug from the polymeric matrix. In this regard, the diffusion of the drug is classified into four basic categories: (i), diffusion of the drug due to water intake, (ii), due to osmotic pressure, (iii) through the polymeric matrix, and (iv), due to erosion mechanism. In the first case, the pores in the polymeric matrix get wider with time due to their biodegradable nature. Water enters the polymeric matrix through these pores and widens them, which ultimately makes sufficient openings for the drug molecules to diffuse out of the polymeric matrix. In the second case, the drug release occurs through the water-filled pores and is based on osmotic pumping. In the third case, the drug diffusion is mainly based on the permeability and thickness of the polymer. In the fourth case, the drug release is based on the rate of degradation of the polymeric matrix. The polymeric material starts degrading from outside to inside and the drug release occurs when the erosion rate is higher than the water penetration rate. This kind of drug release has significance in terms of controllable and reproducible kinetics [<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Polymeric nanoparticles based on chitosan (CS NPs) are acting as an excellent drug carrier because of some intrinsic beneficial properties of CS, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, bioactivity, easy preparation, and relative to some extent, target specific triggered by its cationic character [<xref rid="B18-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The advantages and limitations of CS NPs are summarized in <xref rid="ijms-22-09652-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. CS NPs have a good mucoadhesive capacity, enhanced bioavailability, and dissolution rate of hydrophobic drugs. Besides, CS improves the stability of labile drugs in GIT, their bioavailability, and the controlled release of the drug, as the particles are beyond the nanoscale range to effectively overcome barriers and enhance permeability. However, CS NPs have also some disadvantages (disadvantages of CS itself, leading to the need for its modification, which was discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijms-22-09652">Section 2</xref>). Their low solubility at physiological pH affects the intake and causes a pre-systemic metabolism with the oral administration of drugs. The loading efficiency of CS alone to encapsulate water-insoluble drugs is generally quite low [<xref rid="B54-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Both water-soluble and water-insoluble drugs can be loaded into CS NPs.

Water-insoluble drugs and drugs that can precipitate in acidic pH solutions can be loaded after the formation of particles by soaking the preformed NPs with the saturated solution of the drug.</p><p>Drug release from CS-based particulate systems depends on the extent of cross-linking, morphology, size, and density of the particulate system, physicochemical properties of the drug as well as the presence of adjuvants. In vitro release also depends upon pH, polarity, and the presence of enzymes in the dissolution media. In most cases, drug release follows more than one type of mechanism (as discussed generally for NPs above in this section). In the case of a drug adsorbed on the surface of CS NPs and also in the case of a drug entrapped in the surface layer of NPs, a drug instantaneously dissolves when it is in contact with the release medium. This type of drug release leads to a burst effect in the early stages of dissolution. Drug release by diffusion is initially slow but later becomes fast [<xref rid="B53-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>CS NPs can assume various shapes.

In vitro photothermal tests proved that the NSs had excellent light stability and photothermal conversion performance.

The NCs, formed as a polymeric shell around an oily core, allowed a 99.9% encapsulation efficiency of DCX with a monodispersity particle size in the range of 200 nm and a high positive surface charge that provided substantial stability to the nanosystems.

Their nanofibrous structure offers enormous possibilities for chemical modifications that create new properties applicable, particularly in the biomedical field. CS NFs can be prepared by electrospinning of CS into ultrafine fibers of nano size. Owing to the large specific surface area, NFs can deliver drugs, peptides, and vaccine antigens. The release of the drug may be immediate, delayed, or modified depending on the type of interactions between the polymer and the drug. Usually, an immediate release is noticed when a composition of a water-soluble substance and a water-soluble polymer is used. The prolonged release can be achieved by integrating the drug into other nanocarriers, such as NPs, liposomes, dendrimers, then loaded into NFs or use hydrophobic polymers [<xref rid="B18-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

Antibacterial test in agar diffusion and time-kill study on Staphylococcus aureus also demonstrated that loading teicoplanin in CS/PEO NFs enhanced the antibacterial activity up to 1.5- to 2-fold.

The self-assembling process can take place at the molecular or supramolecular level. It can occur by self-association or by an association with other structures through interactions such as hydrogen bond, van der Waals forces, and ionic or hydrophobic interactions.

Although CS is not an amphiphilic bio-polymer, the self-organizing NPs can be obtained by a structural modification of CS, particularly the introduction of hydrophobic moieties into the CS molecules by grafting, to modify its hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic balance. Such balance is promoting self-assembly in an aqueous or polar medium. The grafting agent can be a hydrophobic moiety, such as cholesterol, cholic, and deoxycholic acid, 5&#946;-cholanic acid, phthaloyl, polyester, fatty acids, etc. [<xref rid="B69-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

This method avoids the use of organic solvents, high temperatures, or vigorous agitation.

Scheme illustrating preparation of CS NPs by ionic crosslinking with TPP is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f003">Figure 3</xref>. When using TPP as a cross-linking agent, the NPs are prepared at room temperature by dissolving CS in a diluted solution of glacial acetic acid and adjusting pH to the expected value by the addition of NaOH. The TPP solution is added dropwise to the CS solution with constant stirring until it forms an opaque suspension, which indicates the formation of particles with an average diameter controlled by the molar ratio of CS/TPP. Factors influencing the mechanism of CS NPs formation by this method are dependent on parameters like the degree of acetylation and MW of CS, intrinsic viscosity, concentration, and the molar ratio of -NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>/TPP. Other factors may also influence the properties of the NPs, such as operating temperature, stirring speed, and flow rate of TPP addition. They can affect particle size and polydispersity, as they appear to significantly reduce the amount of NP aggregation.

They examined three kinds of molecular weight CS cross-linked by different content of TPP; the NPs with a moderate crosslinking degree were smaller. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) data showed the moderate degree of cross-linking NPs had strong antibacterial properties. IR analysis revealed that the interactions between CS NPs with a different crosslinking degree and TPP were different. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the cross-linked CS NPs were amorphous. In conclusion, the crosslinking degree of the TPP cross-linked CS NPs was related to the particle size and antibacterial properties.</p><p>Colloidal chitosan/tripolyphosphate (CS/TPP) particles prepared by ionic gelation have attracted significant attention as potential delivery vehicles for drugs, genes, and vaccines. Yet, there have been several fundamental studies that showed these particles disintegrate at physiological pH (pH 7.2&#8211;7.4) and ionic strength levels. Echeverri-Cuartas et al. [<xref rid="B73-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] explored the possibility of improving a TPP-crosslinked CS NP stability through a chemical modification of CS. Specifically, CS samples with either 76% or 92% degrees of deacetylation (DD) were grafted with either polyethylene glycol (PEG), or folic acid (F). Within the degrees of substitution (~1% for PEG, and 3% and 6% for F), neither PEG nor F qualitatively improved CS NP stability at physiological conditions (pH 7.2). Another way to improve this stability was explored by Abdelgawad et al. [<xref rid="B74-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. They used hexametaphosphate (HMP) instead of TPP as a cross-linking agent. HMP is a hexavalent molecule in the neutral and slightly basic medium which offers more binding sites readily available for interaction with CS. It is thought that increasing the availability of the binding sites in the HMP molecule would result in stronger ionic complexation with CS cationic moieties. Consequently, such stronger binding should improve particles&#8217; stability and lead to average size reduction. A comparative study between CS/TPP and CS/HMP NPs under different complexation conditions was conducted to investigate the effect of HMP on NPs formation. Although the drug loading efficiency of BSA, 96.3%, was higher than when using TPP, 91.87%, the TPP cross-linked particles showed superior stability upon storage. Cai and Lapitsky [<xref rid="B75-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] proved that the particles could be stabilized by their bioactive payloads. They studied the enhancement of the CS/TPP particle stability at physiological ionic strengths, using 150 mM NaCl (pH 5.5) and PBS (pH 6.0) as the dissolution media when associating the CS/TPP particles with model anionic proteins (&#945;-lactalbumin, &#945;-LA, and bovine serum albumin, BSA) and polynucleotides (DNA). Light scattering and UV&#8211;VIS spectroscopy revealed that anionic protein uptake had no impact on particle stability. It was likely due to the relatively weak protein/particle binding at near-physiological ionic strengths, which caused the protein to be rapidly released. Conversely, a DNA uptake increased the CS fractions persisting in a complexed/particulate form in model dissolution media, with the DNA remaining largely complexed to the CS at all investigated conditions. The results suggested that, while most bioactive payloads do not interact with CS strongly enough to stabilize the CS/TPP particles, these particles can be stabilized to dissolution through the incorporation of polyanions.</p><p>The literature on the release performance of CS/TPP micro- and nanoparticles is filled with conflicting results, with some reporting nearly instantaneous release, while others showing the release to be sustained for up to multiple days. To resolve these opposing findings, Cai et al. [<xref rid="B76-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] examined several experimental artifacts that may arise during such in vitro experiments and showed that conflicting findings on release from CS/TPP particles can arise from: (1) incomplete particle separation from the release media upon centrifugation; (2) irreversible particle coagulation; and (3) failure to maintain sink conditions. They provided guidelines for obtaining more reliable release profiles for CS/TPP micro- and nanoparticles and other/related colloidal carriers. To minimize problems with an incomplete particle separation, high centrifugal forces, and long centrifugation times (which exceed those used typically) are needed. A glycerol bed can help to prevent particle coagulation; however, this method no longer appears to work for CS/TPP micro- and nanoparticles after the first 3&#8211;4 centrifugation/redispersion cycles (at least under the centrifugation conditions needed for their full separation with the setup used by the authors). For particles with fast release rates (such as the colloidal CS/TPP particles explored in their work), frequent sampling/solvent replacement must also be used to capture the release kinetics and maintain sink conditions. Due to the long centrifugation times required to fully sediment the particles, however, this ultracentrifugation-assisted solvent re-placement method cannot accurately determine the release profiles. As an alternative, sink conditions can likely be achieved by diluting the dispersions in large volumes of release media and collecting small dispersion portions (after removing the particles with a filter) to quantify the release. The authors demonstrated that it is essential to use release media with physiologically relevant ionic strength levels, as a release from CS/TPP particles can be highly salt-sensitive.</p></sec><sec><title>Polyelectrolyte Complex (PEC)</title><p>A suitable way to generate self-assembled CS NPs is through the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes with polyanions. Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) are formed when the solutions of two polyelectrolytes carrying complementary charges (i.e., a polycation and a polyanion or their corresponding salts) are mixed. In this case, PEC formation is mainly caused by the strong Coulomb interactions between the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. The formation of complexes brings about at least a partial charge neutralization of polymers. In addition, inter-macromolecular interactions such as Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions are involved in the formation of PEC structures as well [<xref rid="B77-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p>The PECs formation generally involves two or three steps. The scheme of the different steps of the polyelectrolyte complexes formation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The first step is instantaneous and leads to the formation of a random primary complex with significant distortions of the configuration of polymer chains. Then, the secondary complex is formed by rearrangement of existing linkages within intracomplexes. It involves the formation of new bonds, e.g., electrostatic bonds, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, etc. Finally, under certain conditions, primary and secondary complexes can aggregate (probably by hydrophobic interactions) and lead to various stable structures: entangled aggregates, fibrils, ordered networks, etc. Preparation of CS PECs is a safe green process in water, with no organic solvents nor chemical cross-linkers or surfactants used. It is a simple fabrication process where spontaneously mixing the oppositely charged polyelectrolyte solutions leads to interpolymer ionic condensation [<xref rid="B78-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p><p>The stability of PECs depends on several factors including the degree of ionization within each polyelectrolyte with an opposite charge, the density of the charges presents in the structure of polyelectrolyte, concentration, and proportion of polyelectrolytes in the mixture, a sequence of additions in the mixture and the type and location of ionic groups. In polymer chains, the stability is also correlated with the MW of the polyelectrolytes, the flexibility of the polymer chain as well as the temperature, ionic resistance, and pH of the reaction medium. The structure of CS-based nanoPECs is highly impacted by the presence of salt. A high concentration of salt may disrupt the integrity of the nanoPECs and dissociate the polyelectrolytes. When the positively charged surface of CS interacts with anionic biopolymers such as sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, chondroitin sulfate, dextran sulfate, poly(acrylic acid), pectin, carrageenans, heparin, and other polyions, various CS-based PECs can be formed [<xref rid="B78-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p><p>Several conditions, such as pH (particularly important in weak polyelectrolytes), ionic strength, and the mixing rate, should be adjusted to the particular CS-polyanion pair system selected since these variables will also influence the size and charge of CS NPs. Different preparation methods will result in diverse kinds of CS NPs, which can be classified as nanoaggregates, nanocapsules, or nanospheres. The particular procedure selected can be largely determined by the water solubility of the active agent that will be encapsulated and the polyanion used [<xref rid="B78-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p><p>By chitosan&#8217;s favorable properties, especially the mucoadhesive nature and absorption enhancement capability, as well as the safe and green manufacturing process of colloidal PECs, CS-based nanoPECs are particularly appropriate for the delivery of sensitive biological molecules such as vaccines and proteins like insulin via the mucosal route. Cationic CS-based PECs can also promote the internalization of the loaded cargos into cells and subsequently escape the lysosome via the proton sponge effect, therefore exhibit high therapeutic potential, e.g., in anti-tumor applications [<xref rid="B77-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot3-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.2.3.

Some of them are low power emulsification methods but emulsification processes usually require high mechanical energy to obtain small droplet sizes.

Preparation of CS NPs by emulsion solvent diffusion method is schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f006">Figure 6</xref>. A drug is dissolved in an organic solvent and is added upon injection to an aqueous phase containing CS with a stabilizing agent such as lecithin or poloxamer. As a result, the simple water-in-oil emulsion is formed upon high-pressure homogenization. The emulsion is then diluted with a large amount of water to overcome organic solvent miscibility in water. Finally, NPs are formed through CS precipitation due to reduced CS solubility as acetone diffuses into the aqueous phase. This leads to the formation of small particles. As the concentration of water-miscible solvent increases, a decrease in the size of particles can be achieved. The isolation of NPs is made using the centrifugation process. This method is suitable for hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic drugs. In the case of hydrophilic drugs, a multiple water/oil/water emulsion (e.g., double emulsion) needs to be formed with the drug dissolved in the internal aqueous phase. The major drawbacks of this method include harsh processing conditions (e.g., the use of organic solvents) and the high shear forces used during NP preparation [<xref rid="B70-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B87-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p><p>Often, this method is used for the preparation of PLGA NPs with CS as a coating material.

The CS NPs obtained under different conditions were assessed in terms of their ability to solubilize curcumin, whose numerous therapeutic properties are somewhat countered by its poor solubility in water.

The high solubility of CS in low pH is reduced by the poor solubility of the ALG network at low pH, while ALG is stabilized at high pH by CS which is less soluble at high pH [<xref rid="B112-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>].</p><p>The other polymers to combine with CS, reported recently in the literature, are dextran [<xref rid="B113-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], curdlan, carrageenan, caseinate [<xref rid="B114-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], and pectin [<xref rid="B115-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>].

They are solid materials with well-ordered cylindrical pore structures. MS NPs have been utilized as delivery vehicles for controlled release due to their excellent characteristics including good biocompatibility, mesoporous structure, and chemical stability. Specifically, MS NPs offer appealing inherent properties including, controllable uniform particle size, high mechanical strength, and stability, as well as high drug loading capacities (they can load relatively larger amounts of bioactive molecules than other kinds of NPs). The fabrication of MS NPs is very simple and cost-effective. With appropriate modifications, these NPs can be taken up by nonphagocytic cells and can then release molecules encapsulated inside the MS NPs to the desired location. Many different types of functional chemical groups have been applied for the fabrication of MS NPs to achieve controlled drug release responding to environmental stimuli such as pH redox potential, enzyme, light, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and temperature [<xref rid="B120-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>,<xref rid="B121-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,<xref rid="B122-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>].</p><p>However, one challenge in applying CS fabricated MS NPs is the premature leaking of the drug even under mild conditions, leading to reduced drug efficacy and nonspecific cytotoxicity. To overcome this issue Chen et al. [<xref rid="B121-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] developed a multi-stimuli responsive surface on the MS NPs for an environmentally sensitive and site-specific drug delivery with reduced risk of premature drug leakage. A cross-linked CS was applied to form a thin film on the drug-loaded MS NPs resulting in a stimuli-sensitive regulating gate membrane. It was further conjugated with folate for a site-specific targeting toward cancer cells. The synthesis procedure of DOX-MSN-BCS-FA and the extracellular and intracellular trafficking for DOX-MSN-BCS-FA to cancer cells is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f017">Figure 17</xref>. The CS film was very stable under neutral conditions and could effectively prevent drug leakage, but was sensitive to both pH and glutathione (GSH) stimulations to reach rapid drug release. Thus, the drug release could be triggered by changes in such factors that are common to cancer cells. However, the complete and accelerated release could only be achieved when triggered simultaneously by both acidic pH and GSH. Moreover, tests with HepG-2 cells confirmed that folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis successfully enhanced the cellular uptake of the NPs and antitumor activity toward cancer cells.</p><p>Liao et al.

They fabricated a dual-pH-sensitive CS/MS NPs-based anticancer drug delivery system loaded with model drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). The MS NP was modified with the benzimidazole (Bz) group. Then chitosan-graft-&#946;-cyclodextrin (CS-&#946;-CD) was applied as the &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; to cover the BzMS NPs through host-guest interaction between &#946;-CD and Bz. After being coated with targeting peptide adamantane-glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine, methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) benzaldehyde was finally grafted on CS through the pH-sensitive benzoic imine bond. Due to the dynamic protection of PEG, the obtained carriers were &#8220;stealthy&#8221; at pH 7.4 but could reveal the shielded targeting peptide and the positive charge of CS in the weakly acidic environment achieved a &#8220;tumor-triggered targeting&#8221;. Inside cancer cells, the interaction between &#946;-CD and Bz group could be destroyed due to the lower pH resulting in DOX release. Both in vitro and in vivo studies proved the DDS could targeting induce cancer cell apoptosis, inhibit tumor growth, and reduce the cytotoxicity of DOX against normal cells. It is expected that the developed CS/MS-based nanocomposite could be a potential choice for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Magnetic Nanoparticles (Mag NPs)</title><p>The use of magnetic nanocomposites in biomedical applications, particularly in cancer imaging and therapy, but also antimicrobial and others, is gaining immense interest. The illustrative scheme of the synthesis and structure ofchitosan-coated magnetic nanoparticles (CS Mag NPs) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f018">Figure 18</xref>. Mag NPs are promising materials for application in magnetic resonance imaging, targeted drug delivery, enzyme immobilization, and cancer therapies based on hyperthermia thanks to their biocompatibility, wide chemical affinity, and superparamagnetic properties [<xref rid="B124-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Superparamagnetism refers to the ability of Mag NPs to gain magnetism in the presence of a magnetic field and lose magnetism when the magnetic field is eliminated. It means the magnetic nanocarriers must be responsive to the magnetic gradient. This behavior of Mag NPs is beneficial for targeted drug delivery when a chemotherapeutic drug can reach the targeting disease site selectively by an application of an external magnetic field [<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B125-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Except for the magnetic field, the drug nanocarriers can respond to other external stimuli (such as pH, ultrasound, temperature, etc.). The change in their physiological properties leads to the release of a specific concentration of bioactive agents at the affected area or organ. Through this process, the effectiveness and specificity of the drug could enhance and leads to lower systemic toxicity. Another important feature of Mag NPs is that they can induce malignant tissues death by magnetic fluid hyperthermia. The particles produce heat in the vicinity of alternating electromagnetic fields. The theory behind magnetic hyperthermia is that cancerous cells are more susceptible to the external stress of heat than normal cells due to low oxygen and nutrients and normal acid concentrations [<xref rid="B18-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B125-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>].</p><p>Khmara et al.

The specific absorption rate (SAR) of both uncoated Mag NPs and modified CS/Mag NPs increased with the applied magnetic field up to ~7.9 kA&#183;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Moreover, the SAR values of CS/Mag NPs were higher than those of Mag NPs demonstrating the possibility of their utilization as nanoheaters for hyperthermic treatment. It was observed that the CS/Mag NPs can destroy &#945;-lactalbumin amyloid fibrils in a concentration-dependent manner. Drug delivery systems prepared with these nanostructures can overcome biological barriers. However, one of the main challenges in the use of these nanosystems is their internalization by macrophages.</p><p>There is still a lack of knowledge of interactions between Mag NPs covered with the bioactive polymers and biological cells.

GO contains many functional groups, a large surface area on both sides of the GO sheets, and a high loading capacity of aromatic molecules and nucleobases through &#960;-&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. GO NPs are designed to increase the concentration of drugs in tumor sites (enhanced permeability and retention effect, EPR), longer circulation time in blood, high drug loading capacity, targeting effect, and controlled drug release. This makes the GO an efficient drug carrier and has been explored in drug delivery applications extensively. The oxidized form of graphene contains various functional groups such as hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups, etc. The epoxy group can be easily modified with amino groups by reducing the bandgap and thereby increasing the adsorption of drug molecules. To enhance the stability of GO NPs in physiological environments, they have been functionalized with hydrophilic and biocompatible polymers (e.g., polysaccharides), which also reduce toxicity and increase solubility and biocompatibility of GO.

They used bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein and studied its stability and activity. SDS page analysis showed no remarkable change after exposing BSA-GO/Mag NPs and BSA-GO/CS/Mag NPs in trypsin after a time duration of 30 min and 3 h, respectively. The GO/CS/Mag NPs exhibited better drug loading and releasing profile when compared with GO/Mag NPs composite. This nanocarrier protected the protein from enzymatic cleavage more efficiently.

The loading and release behavior, biocompatibility, and magnetic properties of the GO/CS/Mag NPs were evaluated using a model drug doxorubicin (DOX). Increased pH resulted in a reduction in the rate of DOX release, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds and the physical prevention of collapsed CS chains. In addition, a decrease in CS molecular weight and an increase in concentration reduced the DOX loading by around 24% yet a decrease in molecular weight increased the released amount by more than 200%. This has been related to fewer hydrogen binding and more contribution of &#960;-&#960; stacking in DOX-CS interactions. Cytotoxicity assays with healthy L929 cell lines revealed high biocompatibility of the GO/CS/Mag NPs, suggesting CS prevents GO contact with the cell membrane. Results showed that the hybrid GO/CS/Mag NPs with high molecular weight CS at a 6.0 g/dL concentration showed optimal properties for theranostic applications.</p></sec><sec><title>Gold Nanoparticles (Au NPs)</title><p>More recently, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have earned widespread application in drug delivery studies due to their unique properties, including biocompatibility, low toxicity, ease of production, and the large surface-to-volume ratio [<xref rid="B132-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>].</p><p>Gold nanospheres, as a kind of photo-absorbing agent, can generate heat from optical light energy for photothermal antitumor therapy.

They used them for the loading of hydrophilic cytarabine (Cyt), an anti-cancer drug, and then wrapped them with CS gels for the encapsulation of the loaded Cyt. The fluorescent stability of GQDs was significantly enhanced in the presence of CS, which might be attributed to the inhibited agglomeration of GQDs by the CS gels. In addition, the burst release of Cyt from the developed carrier was also effectively relieved by the CS coating. Since the incorporation of Cyt into GQDs was achieved by amidation reaction, the delivery of Cyt from the carrier was pH-sensitive due to the hydrolysis of the amido-linkage between GQDs and Cyt in an acidic medium.</p></sec><sec><title>Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) Composite</title><p>CNTs are allotropes of carbon, cylindrical nanostructure consisting of sp2 hybridized carbon atom in a hexagonal arrangement.

Among a variety of biomaterials that can respond to these stimuli, modified CS as a biocompatible polymer with specific functional groups, provides an advantageous platform, as its solubility, hydrophilicity, biodegradability, and chemical behavior can be easily modified concerning conditions of the biological environment. The specific environmental stimulants at diseased sites can be used to initiate and/or control drug release. Modified CS can respond to these pH changes by swelling, shrinking, degrading, protonation, and deprotonation of functional groups, and thus release an encapsulated drug in a controlled manner.

Modification of CS by ROS-responsive entities has been shown to accelerate ROS deactivation, while there was no significant change in ROS content with naked CS. GSH is produced intracellularly and is required for cell life. However, in some diseases such as cancer, it can be increasingly generated in the cells. The enhanced concentration has been used as a stimulus for drug delivery by chemically linking molecules with disulfide bonds, and thus develops easily manipulated GSH-responsive structures. Very recently, Daund et al. [<xref rid="B153-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>] published a review on ROS responsive NPs for smart drug delivery. Jiao et al.

The PEG was further grafted on the surface of CS to increase the stability and biocompatibility under physiological conditions. In vitro release results indicated that DOX was dramatically blocked within the mesopores of NPs in a pH 7.4 PBS without the addition of GSH. However, the release rate of DOX was markedly increased after the addition of 10 mM GSH or in a pH 5.0 release medium. Lin et al.

A dendronized CS derivative as a &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; to control the release of the drug was used to modify MS NPs via a disulfide linker and improve the gene transfection for potential cancer therapy. Stimulus-induced release of the DOX was studied in the presence of glutathione (GSH), which showed that the polymer shell was shed and accelerated the release of embedded drugs inside the tumor cells under a GSH-rich environment. </p><p><italic toggle="yes">Enzyme-responsive NPs:</italic> Enzyme-responsive systems have gained tremendous attention to develop smart biocarriers for drug delivery since, compared with other stimuli-responsive systems, they benefit from both high sensitivity and precise selectivity in the enzyme-overexpressed tissues or cells.

Measurement of in vitro release of prodigiosin from the loaded nanocarriers in the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, alpha-amylase, and chitosanase showed that 58.1 and 44.6% of the drug were released after one hour of incubation.

Many biological therapeutics were rarely used for oral drug delivery due to low water solubility and poor oral bioavailability. An ideal carrier should form stable complexes with active substances in GIT, protecting the active substances from degradation and delivering it to target cells or tissues. Moreover, the optimization of the carrier had pursued nontoxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [<xref rid="B227-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>].</p><p>NPs have various advantages such as small particle size, large surface area, and a potentially modifiable surface that prevents the enzymatic degradation of the drugs in the GIT; therefore, these are used as oral delivery systems for polynucleotides, proteins, and macromolecules. Moreover, they increase the GIT stability of acid-labile drugs. The character of NP is determined by the polymer from which it is composed. CS has an absorption-promoting effect due to its mucoadhesion properties and transient opening of the tight junctions of the mucosal cell membrane. In addition, the interaction between CS (positively charged) and mucin (negatively charged) leads to an increase in contact time between the drug and the absorptive surface, therefore CS increases the half time of clearance. The ability of CS to increase the membrane permeability depends upon its degree of deacetylation and molecular weight. As the degree of deacetylation increases, the charge density of CS also increases which in turn improves the drug transportation, which means that there will be increased epithelial permeability [<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

Second, the intestinal epithelium is a major barrier because peptides and proteins, because of their high molecular weight and hydrophilicity, are difficult to diffuse across the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. And finally, various digestive enzymes in the GIT lead to the degradation of peptides and proteins.

The DT-loaded CS-NPs seem to be a promising prolonged-release drug delivery system for oral administration with a low dose and high efficiency.</p><p>NPs may be also potential carriers for oral delivery of polysaccharides, for example, those from <italic toggle="yes">Ophiopogon japonicus</italic> (OJPs). OJPs are used to treat intestinal barrier defects, such as inflammatory bowel disease, but they are poorly absorbed after oral administration. This results in limited efficacy because of the low bioavailability (due to inflammatory bowel disease). Lin et al. [<xref rid="B171-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] prepared OJPs/chitosan (CS)/whey protein (WP) co-assembled NPs. The results suggested that OJPs-CS/WP-NPs effectively protected the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity against the damage caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage inflammation and attenuated the defects of intestinal epithelial TJ barrier and permeability. </p><p>Ling et al.

Oral administration of Samonella effector enzyme (AvrA) NPs encapsulated in alginate/CS MPs delivered the protein to intestinal epithelia and reduced clinical and histological scores of inflammation in a murine DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced colitis model.</p></sec><sec><title>Oral Vaccines</title><p>Mucosal vaccination is the most effective route to induce a local protective immune response against infections originating at mucosal surfaces (for vaccine delivery see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4dot10-ijms-22-09652">Section 3.4.10</xref>). The oral route offers potential for convenient administration of vaccines that achieve mucosal immune response following specific targeting of antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The gastrointestinal tract, however, is an environment that presents several barriers to vaccine-mediated production of the mucosal immune response. The presence of these barriers necessitates the use of appropriate delivery systems to ensure antigen protection from degradation, enhanced uptake/absorption, and immune cell activation. CS has been explored as a component of particulate delivery systems with the potential to enable clinically effective oral administration of vaccines. This is because antigen encapsulation in particles is considered to be a key strategy in overcoming the hurdles of poor antigen immunogenicity and degradation in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="B174-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>].</p><p>Muye et al. [<xref rid="B173-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>] prepared a novel oral protein (OVA as a model antigen) delivery system for oral vaccination with enhanced intestinal penetration and improved antigen stability based on CS NPs and antigen-&#946;-cyclodextrin and antigen-carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (CM-HP-&#946;-CD) inclusion complex (OVA-&#946;-CD/CS and OVA/CM-HP-&#946;-CD/CS). The SEM (scanning electron microscope) photographs of prepared NPs and inclusion complexes are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f027">Figure 27</xref>. In vitro drug release studies, mimicking oral delivery conditions of the OVA-&#946;-CD loaded CS NPs, showed a low initial release at pH 1.2 for 2 h less than 3.0% and a delayed-release which was below to 30% at pH 6.8 for subsequent 72 h. More importantly, after oral administration of the OVA-&#946;-CD loaded CS NPs to Balb/c mice, OVA-specific sIgA levels in jejunum were 3.6-fold and 1.9-fold higher than that of an OVA solution and OVA loaded CS NPs, respectively. In vivo evaluation results showed that the OVA-&#946;-CD loaded CS NPs could enhance their efficacy for inducing an intestinal mucosal immune response. In conclusion, these data suggested that CD/CS NPs could serve as a promising antigen-delivery system for oral vaccination.</p><p>The capacity of CS to facilitate drug delivery across mucosal surfaces is attributed to its mucoadhesive properties and its ability to open the epithelial tight junctions, as structures that keep adjacent epithelial cells near one another. CS can complex a model antigen into nano-size entities. Although these systems show interesting effects in vitro, namely notable augmentation of antigen delivery across an intestinal epithelial monolayer model, this does not reliably predict in vivo systemic immune response following oral delivery. Cole et al. [<xref rid="B174-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>] compared in vitro and in vivo antigen delivery effects of ultrapure CS chloride. They formulated CS NPs to incorporate OVA as a model antigen and characterized for size, charge, OVA complexation, and release. Nanocomplexes displayed favorable delivery properties, namely OVA release and no notable cytotoxicity. The OVA-CS complex markedly enhanced antigen delivery across Caco-2 monolayers. However, the system did not elicit notable in vivo immune responses (some mucosal response was apparent) following oral delivery. The study highlights that a clear effect on antigen permeability across epithelial monolayers in vitro may predict the in vivo mucosal but not systemic immune response following oral delivery.</p><p>Mucosal administration of the vaccine can produce a strong immune response. Antigens adhere to &#8220;M-cells&#8221;, present at the intestinal mucosa and the M-cells produce immunity after actively transporting luminal antigens to the underlying immune cells. Saraf et al. [<xref rid="B175-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>] prepared and characterized alginate-coated chitosan (ALG/CS NPs) loaded with HBsAg (hepatitis B antigen) as an antigen to produce immunity; they were additionally anchored with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an adjuvant. Results showed that the alginate coating effectively protected antigen at GIT in an acidic medium. The anchoring with LPS showed increased immunity as compared to other formulations (e.g., without LPS and alginate). Additionally, the NPs elicited significant sIgA at mucosal secretions and IgG antibodies in the systemic circulation. Thus, the prepared LPS anchored ALG-coated CS NPs may be a promising approach as a vaccine delivery system for oral mucosal immunization.</p><p>Another approach to improve oral vaccine efficiency is the use of layered double hydroxide (LDHs) NPs. They have shown excellent capability and good adjuvant function as a nanocarrier for protein antigen delivery to enhance the immune response. Furthermore, LDHs have good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. However, their oral vaccine delivery efficiency is limited due to acidic/enzyme degradation in the stomach and low bioavailability in the small intestine. To overcome these challenges, Yu et al. [<xref rid="B176-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>] developed an alginate&#8211;chitosan-coated LDH NP (ALG/CS/LDH NP) based nanocomposites as a carrier system for oral protein vaccine delivery (BSA and OVA as model antigens). The protein release profile of the ALG/CS/LDH NP nanocomposites indicated that the ALG/CS coating could partially protect protein release at the acidic condition (pH 1.2). The cellular uptake results have demonstrated the ALG/CS coating LDHs can significantly enhance the attachment and internalization of proteins in the intestine cells and macrophages. The enhancement of the ALG/CS coating LDHs is attributed to their strong interaction with the saccharide receptors and surface proteins. In conclusion, ALG/CS-LDHs have shown great potential for oral protein vaccine delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Oher Drugs</title><p>Liu et al.

In vivo, the oral absolute bioavailability of sCT in CS-sCT/PR-NPs was 12.52 &#177; 1.83%, approximately 1.74-fold higher than that of the NPs not co-loaded with PR.

PLNs with the optimal composition significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of enoxaparin with a 4.5-fold increase in AUC (area under the curve) in comparison with a solution of enoxaparin. In conclusion, glycerol monooleate (GMO)/CS-based PLNs can provide a new insight to develop an orally applicable delivery system for hydrophilic macromolecules. Their absorption can be enhanced with the proposed PLNs and the preparation of these PLNs was also found to be easy comparing to other similar methods.</p><p>CS NPs hold promising features also as an oral delivery vehicle for various lipophilic drugs. Astaxanthin (ASTX) has been reported as a potential therapeutic agent for hepatic fibrosis treatment. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to low bioavailability and poor aqueous solubility. Hu et al.

Its nanostructure was cross-linked using oxidized dextran (Odex) via Schiff base reaction. Compared to the anti-fibrogenic effect of free ASTX in LX-2 cells, the encapsulated ASTX demonstrated dramatically enhanced cellular bioactivity, as evidenced by significantly lower TGF&#946;1-induced fibrogenic gene (ACTA2 and COL1A1) expression level, as well as &#945;-SMA and COL1A1 protein levels.</p><p>Raloxifene, marketed as raloxifene hydrochloride (RLX), is the only &#8216;selective estrogen receptor modulator&#8217;, approved worldwide for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and fragility fractures.

Pharmacokinetic studies in female Wistar rats showed significant improvement (ca. 4.2 fold) in the oral bioavailability of the drug when loaded into the NPs. Further, the modified everted gut sac study showed that these NPs are taken up by active endocytic processes in the intestine. The ex vivo mucoadhesion studies proved that the NPs bound to the mucus layer of the intestine, which in turn correlated with reduced excretion of the drug in feces.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot2-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.4.2. Ocular Drug Delivery</title><p>Ophthalmic diseases are generally treated using topical instillation&#8212;eye drops of active compounds. However, the method of treatment has been hindered by the inherent defense function of the eye [<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The corneal epithelial cells restrict drug proliferation due to blocking the passage of the drug through the cornea. Drugs are degraded by metabolic enzymes in the ocular tissues. Drugs applied to the surface of the eyes are excreted through nasolacrimal ducts. Additionally, spontaneous reject of foreign substances by the oculus also impedes drug transport. Thus, ocular administration remains a clinical challenge [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To increase ocular absorption and improve the drug bioavailability, the research of new drug carriers has become the development trend. CS possesses favorable characteristics such as nontoxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, which make it a suitable choice for ocular drug delivery systems. In addition, it is naturally mucoadhesive, which increases the ocular surface duration of drugs. CS also possesses in situ gelling properties due to which, when it is applied on the ocular surface in liquid form, it gets transformed into gel later. This leads to the improvement of the ocular residence time and therapeutic efficacy of the drug [<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Efficient ocular drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye by topical administration is a great challenge to pharmacologists. Dexamethasone (DEX) is one of the most widely used steroidal agents for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders of the eye with high potency and effectiveness. Yu et al.

The eye irritation of DEX-GCS NPs was investigated in Japanese white rabbits using a modified Draize test. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f028">Figure 28</xref>A, the eyes treated by DEX-GCS NPs and NS at 2 h did not present any conjunctival congestion, corneal opacity, or iris-inflammatory exudation.

Moreover, histological observation indicated that there were no obvious morphological or pathological changes to the cornea after treatment with DEX-GCS NPs and normal saline after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f028">Figure 28</xref>C). Moreover, the intraocular pressure (IOP) did not change obviously for the eyes treated with DEX-GCS NPs during the 3-day study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f028">Figure 28</xref>C). The proposed NPs showed good ocular tolerance and provided a relatively longer precorneal duration compared with that of the aqueous solution formulation, which suggested that the self-assembled DEX-GCS NP might be a promising candidate for ophthalmic drug delivery.</p><p>In another work, Wang et al.

The in vitro experiments on human conjunctival epithelial cells showed no cytotoxicity (LDH concentration &#8804;100.0 &#181;g/mL) but enhanced permeability for hybrid nanocomposites. Results of the in vivo precorneal retention study showed an 8.35-fold, 2.87-fold, and 2.58-fold increase in AUC 0&#8211;6 h, C max and MRT for DEXP-CMC/GSH/GlySar/LDH (10:1) hybrid nanocomposite eye drops, respectively, compared to that of the commercial product. In the evaluation of tissue distribution of rabbit&#8217;s eyes, DEXP of the DEXP-CMC/GSH/GS/LDHs (10:1) nanocomposite retained in the target of the choroid-retina for 3 h with final concentration at 120.04 ng/g. Furthermore, the results of fluorescence imaging and tissue distribution suggested that the intraocular transport pathway for the hybrid nanocomposites is the conjunctival-scleral route. Consequently, the developed hybrid nanocomposites offer a simple and efficient strategy for topically administered drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye.</p><p>Liposomes have shown significantly improved penetration potential and compatibility upon comparison with other systems. A coating of liposomes with CS can further improve their availability owing to the mucoadhesive properties which increase the affinity of composite membranes. Khalil et al. [<xref rid="B180-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>] prepared chitosan-coated liposomes (CS/LIP). Conventional liposomes encapsulating triamcinolone acetonide (TA) were compared with their CS-coated counterpart for the drug loading and release studies. CS/LIP showed a higher encapsulation efficiency (74%), and a highly positive surface charge (+41.1 Mv), increased retention time, and sustained release. The results showed successful penetration of the construct via the corneal mucosal barrier and its accumulation in the vitreous body. The analysis shows that this CS-based liposomal construct can be employed as a potential topical delivery system for treating posterior segment diseases.</p><p>Levofloxacin (LFX) is a synthetic third generation of fluoroquinolones with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Ameeduzzafar et al. [<xref rid="B181-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>] tried to combine in-situ gel and NPs. They used CS NPs to encapsulate LFX for the treatment of ocular infection.

Drug release of PA as received, in simulated tears fluid (pH 7.4), showed a twofold increase (reaching an average of 98.6% in 24 h) when incorporated into an optimized nanoparticle gel formulation (1:5 CS-SD). The anti-inflammatory effect of PA NPs loaded gel on female guinea pig eyes was significantly superior to that of the micronized drug-loaded gel (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

Clinically, it is used to depress apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells which is related to visual decline. Additionally, BAI protects against retinal ischemia by anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, BAI has great potential in preventing and treating various ocular diseases such as keratitis and glaucoma. However, molecular dynamics simulation data showed that BAI had a poor membrane permeability, which limited the ocular bioavailability. To improve its ocular bioavailability, Li et al. [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] prepared and characterized trimethyl chitosan-coated lipid nanoparticles of baicalein (TMC-BAI-LNPs).

This disease is characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The main object in the treatment of glaucoma is to reduce IOP to the normal range (16&#8211;18 mmHg). Dorzolamide (DRZ), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI), is the most common drug used to treat glaucoma by reducing IOP via decreasing aqueous humor secretion (through the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme). Shahab et al. [<xref rid="B82-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] developed dorzolamide-loaded chitosan-coated polycaprolactone nanoparticles (DRZ-CS-PCL-NPs) for improved ocular delivery. The corneal flux experiment showed many fold enhancement in permeation across goat cornea. DRZ-CS-PCL-NPs exhibited 3.7-fold higher mucoadhesive strength compared to the control. Furthermore, the histopathological assessment and HET-CAM study revealed that the DRZ-CS-PCL-NPs were non-irritant and safe for ocular administration. Therefore, it can be concluded the optimized DRZ-CS-PCL-NPs are safe and have the potential for successful ocular delivery and improved therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>Another drug latanoprost reduces IOP by increasing the uveoscleral outflow. Despite its potency, long-term daily application of it may cause undesirable side effects and may require more than one medication for IOP control. Recent studies have suggested that oxidative stress in the trabecular meshwork (TM) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of impaired trabecular outflow facilities. Cheng et al.

The results demonstrated that 20 &#956;M of CUR-NPs might be the optimal concentration to treat TM cells without causing cytotoxicity. </p><p>Intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (BEV) have been used for the treatment of several eye disorders such as diabetic macular edema, central retinal vein occlusion, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, rubeosis iridis, pseudophakia cystoid macular edema, choroid neovascularization, secondary to pathologic myopia. The in vivo studies revealed the absence of ocular toxicity for BEV administered by intravenous injection.

The double crosslinking (ionic and covalent) procedure in the reverse emulsion provided the mechanical stability of the polymeric nanocarrier. The potential of MNPs as a drug delivery system was analyzed by loading a full-length monoclonal antibody BEV. The proposed MNPs were found to be suitable from the cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility point of view enabling their potential use as a delivery system for the treatment of a posterior segment of the eye conditions. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot3-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.4.3.

It is an alternative method of topical administration for anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, nasal congestion, or hemostasis therapy, but nasal administration can even pass the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) that has been proven to conveniently direct drug delivery from the nose to the brain, NTB [<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nasally administered drugs can rapidly reach the brain through three different pathways (i.e., three ways of nasal absorption): the first is the olfactory nerves, which represent the main direct pathway for the NTB drug delivery; then the trigeminal nerves, which have nerve endings in the respiratory epithelia; finally, the respiratory epithelium through which the drugs reach the circulation and subsequent cross the BBB. However, the NTB delivery is characterized by several limitations such as the small volume of the nasal cavity, the mucociliary clearance, the enzymatic degradation, the low drug retention time, the potential nasomucosal toxicity, the technique of drug administration and deposition, and the necessity of a suitable delivery device. The rich vascularization of the nasal mucosa provides a series of unique attributes that can increase safety, patient compliance, the rate of absorption of the drug, and, consequently, the speed of onset of the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, the nasal mucosa is easily accessible compared to other membranes and it is a favorable entry route for both small and large molecules. The nasal bioavailability of small molecules is good and the drugs that are not absorbed orally can be conveyed to the nasal systemic circulation [<xref rid="B186-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. </p><p>CS increases the permeability of the hydrophilic drugs, nucleic acids, proteins, and peptides across the nasal epithelium as they pose difficulty due to their low permeability. Certain characteristics such as weight, lipophilicity, and charge of the drug affect its nasal absorption. The drugs which are unable to cross the nasal membrane undergo mucociliary clearance. A mucoadhesive system can help to overcome this problem and CS possesses mucoadhesion properties along with low toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, owing to its application in nasal delivery [<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><sec><title>Topical Nasal Delivery</title><p>According to the therapeutic effect, nasal delivery can be topical or systemic.

CS is widely used for the preparation of different nasal mucoadhesive formulations that can be retained for an extended time in the nasal cavity and, at the same time, it can enable the transport of drugs across the membrane. Cromolyn (CRO) inhibits the degranulation of sensitized mast cells, thereby blocking the release of inflammatory mediators. Abruzzo et al.

The obtained positively charged NPs, sized 180&#8211;400 nm, showed interesting properties in terms of yield, mucoadhesion, encapsulation efficiency, and drug loading. Release and permeation/penetration data indicated the ability of the NPs to retain a high amount of CRO inside the mucosa, which is rich in mast cells. These findings suggest developing decongestant NPs for the potential treatment of allergic rhinitis.</p><p>Cetirizine (CTZ) is a common H1-antihistamine in allergic disorders therapy but hydrophobicity, the rapid disintegration of conventional dosage forms, and irritation to the nasal mucosa limit its application.

Intranasally administered vaccines remain in the nasal cavity for about 15 min only; they have to be transported over a very small distance and have to be protected from low pH and enzymatic degradation. Mucoadhesive NPs are recognized for the benefits they offer via nasal delivery, such as extended retention time of the vaccine on the mucosa. Various CS-based vaccines for nasal delivery were prepared, containing for example influenza, diphtheria, and pertussis antigens [<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunization effect of live attenuated Japanese encephalitis-chimeric virus vaccine (JECV)-loaded mucoadhesive NPs via the IN route to improve the mucosal immunization against JE. The used NPs were based on chitosan or chitosan maleimide (CM), a novel mucoadhesive polymer. The results revealed that such IN immunization stimulated seroprotection following PRNT50 (plaque reduction neutralization titer) evaluation. Comparing to the SC immunization in mice, this IN immunization provided a higher sIgA level, leading to an improved mucosal immune response. In addition, the CS-based NPs showed an adjuvant effect on the IN vaccine due to their mucoadhesive and antigen-uptake properties. The JECV-loaded mucoadhesive NPs represent a promising approach for IN vaccination as an alternative route for JE protection due to the stimulatory effects on both mucosal and systemic immune responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Nose to Brain Delivery</title><p>Hydrophilic molecules and high molecular weight compounds are not favorably absorbed by the brain due to the presence of BBB and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCB) that cause a selective permeability to circulating molecules. In the last years, NTB (nose to the brain) delivery is an emerging strategy to overcome these barriers and to deliver the drug directly into the brain. Pharmaceutical nanotechnologies appear as an ideal formulation strategy for NTB delivery. Piazzini et al.

The CS-coated NPs showed better mucoadhesion on ex vivo rabbit nasal mucosa and the higher penetrating potential of HSA/CS NPs concerning uncoated NPs. They have also the advantage of opening the tight junctions between hCMEC/D3 cells, by decreasing the levels of ZO-1 expression, allowing for the transport of molecules across the barrier.</p><p>Neurologic disorders such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) require direct transport of therapeutic substances to the brain to maximize drug concentration in their active site. PD is characterized by neurodegeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Central Nervous System (CNS). To date, the standard treatment for controlling PD motor symptoms is based on the dopamine (DOPA) replacement strategy which aims to compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons and re-establish satisfactory levels of the neurotransmitter. DOPA is unable to overcome the BBB because of its high hydrogen-bonding potential, complete ionization at physiological pH, and extensive metabolism by the oral route of administration. Therefore, most interest has been focused on the development of DOPA-loaded nanocarriers as an innovative tool for the PD treatment which should be able to cross the BBB and enable a sustained delivery of the neurotransmitters to the brain. Ropinirole hydrochloride (RH) is a non-ergoline agonist that acts on D2- and D3-receptors in the brain. Chatzitaki et al.

RH-loaded PLGA/CS NPs showed a complete release of the drug in a simulated nasal electrolyte solution (SNES) throughout 24 h. In addition, they increased the permeation of RH through sheep nasal mucosa by 3.22-fold in comparison to PLGA NPs. None of the RH-loaded NPs induced the hemolysis in whole blood or the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Raw 264.7 cells. In their turn, PLGA/CS NPs decreased cell viability of Raw 264.7 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a concentration-dependent manner. These results revealed that PLGA/CS NPs could be a valuable carrier for the delivery of RH to the CNS, opening a new path for Parkinson&#8217;s disease therapy.</p><p>Cassano et al. [<xref rid="B188-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] synthesized a novel carboxylated chitosan-dopamine (DOPA) and -tyrosine (Tyr) conjugates as systems for improving the brain delivery of the DOPA following nasal administration. For this purpose, ester or amide conjugates were synthesized by N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) mediated coupling reactions between the appropriate N-tertbutyloxycarbonyl (Boc) protected starting polymers N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan and 6-carboxy chitosan, and DOPA or O-tert-Butyl-L-tyrosine-tert-butyl ester hydrochloride. The results demonstrated that N,O-carboxymethyl CS-DOPA (N,O-CMC-DOPA) conjugate was the most mucoadhesive polymer in the series examined, and together with the 6-carboxy CS-DOPA conjugate, they were able to release the neurotransmitter in simulated nasal fluid (SNF). The MTT assay showed that the starting polymers, as well as all the prepared conjugates in olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), resulted not toxic at any concentration tested. Likewise, the three synthesized conjugates were not cytotoxic as well. Cytofluorimetric analysis revealed that the N,O-carboxymethyl CS DOPA conjugate was internalized by OECs in a superior manner at 24 h compared with the starting polymer. Overall, the N,O-CMC-DOPA conjugate seems promising for improving the delivery of DOPA by nose-to-brain administration. </p><p>Rotigotine, a non-ergoline dopamine agonist, is highly effective for the treatment of PD. However, despite its therapeutic potential, its&#8217; clinical applications were hindered due to low aqueous solubility, first-pass metabolism, and low bioavailability. Bhattamisra et al. [<xref rid="B191-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>] developed rotigotine-loaded CS NPs (RNPs) for nose-to-brain delivery and evaluated its neuronal uptake, antioxidant and neuroprotective effects using cell-based studies. Behavioral and biochemical testing of RNPs in haloperidol-induced PD rats showed a reversal of catalepsy, akinesia, and restoration of swimming ability. A decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and an increase in catalase activities were also observed in the brain tissues. The results from the animal model of PD showed that intranasally administered RNPs enhanced brain targeting efficiency and drug bioavailability. Thus, RNPs for nose-to-brain delivery have significant potential to be developed as a treatment approach for PD.</p><p>Huntington&#8217;s disease (HD) is an inherited autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive deterioration in cognition, mood, and motor control. The mutated HTT gene (mHTT) produces a misfolded protein that accumulates in neural cells causing gradual neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Therapies to lower gene expression in brain disease currently require chronic administration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by intrathecal infusions or direct intracerebral injections. Though well-tolerated in the short term, this approach is not tenable for a lifetime of administration. Sava et al. [<xref rid="B189-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>] synthesized enriched CS-based NPs loaded with anti-HTT small interfering RNA (siRNA) for nose-to-brain delivery. The NPs were studied in a transgenic YAC128 mouse model of HD. A series of CS-based NP formulations encapsulating anti-HTT siRNA was designed to protect the payload from degradation &#8220;en route&#8221; to the target. Factors to improve the production of effective nanocarriers of anti-HTT siRNA were identified and tested in a YAC128 mouse model of Huntington&#8217;s disease. Some of the formulations were identified to be effective in lowering HTT mRNA expression by at least 50%. Intranasal administration of NPs carrying siRNA is a promising therapeutic alternative for safe and effective lowering of mutant HTT expression.</p><p>Migraine is a neurovascular disorder that involved dilatation of cerebral arteries and is commonly associated with a symptom such as nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, vomiting, and urinary frequency. Zolmitriptan (ZOL) is one of the most common types of triptans, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists, which inhibit the peripheral trigeminovascular system and can access central sites in the brain stem. ZOL occurs at low blood levels after therapeutic administration, it has low bioavailability (approximately 40%) when administered orally due to hepatic first-pass metabolism. Kherzi et al. [<xref rid="B190-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>] prepared a nasal spray from ZOL-loaded CS NPs and evaluated the drug for its pharmacokinetic properties. Amounts of the drug in the plasma from the test formulation, standard marketed drug (Zolmist), and standard drug solution at 10 min were found to be 41.37 &#177; 2.31, 34.76 &#177; 4.22, and 23.74 &#177; 2.42 ng/mL, respectively. These data indicated significantly (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) a higher amount of the drug being delivered from the test formulation compared to both standard groups. The amount of ZOL present in brain tissue (Olfactory lobe) at 60 min was found to be 15 &#177; 0.08, 13 &#177; 0.14, and 8 &#177; 0.13 ng/g for the test formulation, marketed standard, and standard drug solution, respectively. This indicated a significantly (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher amount of drug absorption in the brain tissue from the test formulation compared to both standard groups. The pharmacokinetic studies of a nasal spray containing ZOL-loaded CS NPs proved rapid onset of action in animals and this formulation is promising in the treatment of migraine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot4-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.4.4. Pulmonary Drug Delivery</title><p>Drug delivery to the lungs has various advantages such as rapid and sustained drug delivery, high efficacy, no first-pass metabolism, and both local and systemic effects can be achieved.

NPs can be used to deliver macromolecular drugs such as peptides and protein through the lung for the treatment of systemic or local diseases.

The inhaled particles should have an aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 5 &#956;m to enable the drugs to be deposited in the deep lungs. CS NPs are exhalation prone and agglomerative to pulmonary inhalation. Alhajj et al. [<xref rid="B228-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>] aimed to develop a new NPs lung delivery approach possible for use in lung cancer treatment. They physically blended CS NPs with fine lactose-PEG3000 microparticles, Lac/PEG3000 MPs (~5 &#956;m) to reduce their agglomeration through surface adsorption phenomenon. This carrier exhibited a comparable inhalation performance with the commercial dry powder inhaler products (fine particle fraction between 20% and 30%). Cascade impactor analysis indicated that the aerosolization and inhalation performance of the CS NPs was promoted by their higher zeta potential, circularity, and larger size attributes. These properties led to reduced inter-nanoparticulate aggregation and favored the NPs interacting with the Lac/PEG3000 MPs that aided their delivery into deep and peripheral lungs.</p><p>Ahmad et al. [<xref rid="B193-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>] studied possibilities to improve the lungs bioavailability of an anti-lungs cancer drug catechin hydrate (CAT) via the direct nose-to-lungs delivery. For this purpose, they prepared novel chitosan-coated PLGA NPs. SEM (A) and TEM (B) images of CS-coated-CAT-loaded PLGA NPs are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f029">Figure 29</xref>. Higher entrapment efficiency was observed for the CAT-CS/PLGA NPs. The release pattern of the CAT-CS/PLGA NPs was found to favor the release of entrapped CAT within the cancer microenvironment. The CAT-CS/PLGA NPs exposed on H1299 cancer cells up to 24.0 h were found to exhibit higher cytotoxicity as compared to a CAT-solution. The CAT-CS/PLGA NPs showed higher apoptosis of cancer cells after their exposure as compared to the CAT-solution. The CAT-CS/PLGA NPs showed tremendous mucoadhesive nature as compared to the CAT-solution. The improved Cmax (668.24 &#177; 29.66 ng/mL) with AUC0&#8211;24 (11370.02 &#177; 191.05 min &#215; ng/mL) was observed extremely significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) via i.n. as compared to <bold>oral</bold> (Cmax 208.76 &#177; 17.01 ng/mL, AUC0&#8211;24 2223.77 &#177; 42.08 min &#215; ng/mL) and i.v.

The CS/PLGA NPs system was successfully designed and safely delivered CAT to the lungs without causing any risk. The CAT-CS/PLGA NPs were showed to have a significant role in the enhancement of lungs bioavailability and, thus, represent a promising approach to treat lung cancers.</p><p>Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of death worldwide, being the leading cause of a single infectious agent. Rifampicin (RIF) is a drug used in tuberculosis treatment being the first choice in association with other drugs for long periods, resulting in low adherence to the oral conventional treatment. Furthermore, RIF shows a low aqueous solubility, and thus, low bioavailability. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can improve the efficacy of antituberculosis drugs and minimize the adverse effects of entrapped drugs. Their association with CS improves the mucoadhesive properties of the NPs. Vieira et al. [<xref rid="B194-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>] developed and characterized SLNs loaded with RIF aiming to enhance mucoadhesion of the SLNs and, consequently, internalization by the alveolar macrophages (AMs). Prepared SLNs coated with CS by the association method (CS SLNs) showed an effective mucoadhesive profile, verified by the turbidimetry and surface loading method, corroborated with the cellular assays. The presence of CS in the CS SLNs promotes not only enhanced mucoadhesive properties of the SLNs but also their higher permeability in the human A549 cell line, suggesting that the safe RIF-CS SLNs can be used as a promising drug delivery system for improving tuberculosis treatment.</p><p>Asthma can be well managed with glucocorticoids and long-acting &#946;-agonists. However, higher doses have proved to be both clinically ineffective and potentially detrimental, where poorly treated inflammation causes repeated exacerbations and sudden deaths in severe asthmatic conditions. An alternative anti-inflammatory intervention, capacitated to control airway remodeling and hypersensitivity without the risk of adverse effects, is crucial to achieving effective disease control and prevention of repeated exacerbations. Most of the pulmonary therapeutics suffer from limitations like poor bioavailability and short half-life. The development of new formulations tailored with suitable surface chemistry and actuation technique for effective drug deposition, interaction, and transportation across the mucus layer is crucial to achieving a high therapeutic index. Vibrating mesh nebulizers are recognized as the most efficient actuation technique over conventional inhalers for drug deposition. Dhayanandamoorthy et al. [<xref rid="B196-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>] explored hyaluronic acid (HA) decorated, ferulic acid (FA) loaded chitosan NPs (FA-HA/CS NPs) aerosolized using vibrating mesh nebulizer as a strategic combination of drug, nanocarrier, and delivery device for effective asthma control. In vivo inhalation toxicity assessment confirmed safety, while FA-HA/CS NPs prophylaxis mitigated the inflammation, airway hypersensitivity, and remodeling in OVA-induced mice models of asthma. Thus, the results accentuated the role of pro-pulmonary surface chemistry conferred by HA functionalization that improved (i) thermal stability (as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis) and (ii) therapeutic efficacy of FA, by facilitating better interaction and transportation across mucus barrier (which otherwise suffers from poor bioavailability and rapid metabolism).</p><p>Etophylline (ETO), a bronchodilator used to treat airway diseases like asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), works by relaxing the smooth muscles of the lungs and dilating the bronchioles. Currently, tablet and injection dosage forms are commercially available. However, poor bioavailability with oral dose (owing to ETO incomplete absorption and high first-pass effect) and patient&#8217;s discomfort with painful injectable administration calls for the alternative formulation approach. Pardeshi et al. [<xref rid="B195-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>] fabricated the ETO encapsulated mannose-anchored N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (Mn-TMC NPs). The prominent characteristics like biocompatibility, controlled release, targeted delivery, high penetrability, enhanced physical stability, and scalability marked the Mn-TMC NPs as a viable alternative to various nanoplatform technologies for effective drug delivery. Mannosylation of TMC NPs led to the evolution of a new drug delivery vehicle with gratifying characteristics, and potential benefits at efficient drug therapy. It is widely accepted that following pulmonary administration, i.e., the introduction of mannose to the surface of drug nanocarriers, provides selective macrophage targeting via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in a Wistar rat model revealed a significant improvement in the therapeutic efficacy of ETO, illustrating mannosylation of CS NPs as a promising approach for efficient therapy of airway diseases following pulmonary administration</p><p>Tobacco smoking and nicotine addiction are common public health problems all over the world causing to death of more than 6 million people per year. The harmful effects of tobacco smoking are primarily due to the other by-products of tobacco combustion such as tar constituents and carbon monoxide rather than nicotine. It is of interest to determine if there is an opportunity to develop a dry powder form of inhalable nicotine formulation and assess its applicability in reducing the health problems associated with smoking. The pulmonary route of nicotine delivery would be expected to mimic the effects of tobacco smoking and would significantly reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Wang et al. [<xref rid="B192-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>] built a nose-only inhalation device for pulmonary administration of nicotine to mice and determined the optimal operational parameters. They used the locomotor activity test to compare the effects of the inhaled nicotine hydrogen tartrate-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (NHT-CS NPs) with an inhaled and subcutaneously injected NHT in C57BL/6 mice. A minimum of 0.88 mg inhaled of NHT-CS NPs or 0.59 mg inhaled of NHT was required to alter locomotor activity similarly to injection of 0.50 mg/kg nicotine, suggesting the reformulation process did not alter the activity of NHT-CS NPs. No differences between untreated and NHT-CS NPs treated lung tissue upon histological examination were observed. The results indicated the inhaled NHT-CS NPs represent a viable preclinical option for developing novel inhalation formulations as a potential anti-smoking therapeutic.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot5-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.4.5. Buccal Drug Delivery</title><p>Buccal drug delivery has been used as an alternative for the delivery of drugs that undergo the first-pass metabolism or are susceptible to pH and enzymatic degradation (occurring in the gastrointestinal tract). This kind of delivery increases the drug bioavailability and reduces the number of drugs required. In addition, through this route, the drugs of high molecular weight can be delivered which cannot be administered by the oral route. Ideally, a buccal drug shows controlled drug release and a prolonged time of residence in the oral cavity [<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, the drug concentration absorbed in the buccal mucosa is often low to obtain an acceptable therapeutic effect, mainly due to the saliva turnover, tongue and masticatory movements, phonation, enzymatic degradation, and lack of epithelium permeation. Therefore, the encapsulation of drugs into NPs is an important strategy to avoid such problems and improve their buccal delivery. Different materials from lipids to natural or synthetic polymers and others have been used to protect and deliver drugs in a sustained, controlled, or targeted manner, and enhance their uptake through the buccal mucosa improving their bioavailability and therapeutic outcome [<xref rid="B229-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. Mucoadhesive CS-based electrospun nanofibers have been reported to be promising candidates for overcoming challenges associated with sublingual drug delivery. For example, Stie et al. [<xref rid="B198-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>] focused on the elucidation of the mucoadhesive properties of chitosan/polyethylene oxide (PEO) nanofibers. They studied how the degree of deacetylation (DDA, 53&#8211;96%) of CS influenced their morphological and mucoadhesive properties. The representative SEM images (dry) and weight loss of CS/PEO nanofibers electrospun with CS of various DDA (53%, 71%, 82%, or 96%) after exposure to water for 3 h are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f030">Figure 30</xref>. The mechanism of mucoadhesion was explained by the intermolecular interactions of CS with mucin from bovine submaxillary glands using quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and by adhesion of the nanofibers to ex vivo porcine sublingual mucosa. An increase in CS DDA improved the morphological stability of the nanofibers in water but did not contribute to altered mucoadhesive properties.</p><p>Because of the very low oral bioavailability of insulin, transmucosal delivery routes have gained much attraction. Limiting factors (swallowing of the delivery device, mucus turnover, and dilution of drug with saliva) can be overcome using polymers with high mucoadhesiveness such as CS and CS-derived nanoparticulate buccal systems [<xref rid="B197-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Such mucoadhesive drug delivery systems facilitate the release of insulin for a prolonged period at the site of application, and thereby maintain a high drug concentration gradient across the tissue, improving the total drug permeation through the mucosa. Encapsulation of insulin in innovative drug delivery systems such as NPs may also further protect the drug from degradation and washout by saliva, as well as control the drug release kinetics. </p><p>Improved mucoadhesive properties of thiolated polymers, such as improved tensile strength, high cohesive properties, rapid swelling, and water uptake behavior, have made them an attractive new generation of bioadhesive polymers. It has been proven that thiolation of CS results in the promotion of mucoadhesion and permeation enhancing effect of CS. Rahbarian et al. [<xref rid="B197-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>] synthesized and characterized insulin NPs composed of N-triethyl chitosan thiolated with L-Cysteine (CysTEC) as a new generation of thiolated CS derivatives. The preparation of the NPs via a PEC method was optimized using the Box-Behnken experimental design methodology leading to smaller particle size and polydispersity index (PdI) as well as higher zeta potential and entrapment efficiency. The in vitro and ex vivo study results demonstrated that insulin NPs composed of CysTEC had excellent permeation from buccal mucosa. However, the authors suggested additional in vivo experiments are needed to further confirm these findings.</p><p>Tumors located in the oral mucosa are challenging to treat via buccal drug delivery since surgery can lead to aesthetic, speech, and salivation problems, radiotherapy alone is often ineffective, and systemic chemotherapy brings meaningful side effects to the patient [<xref rid="B230-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Local administration of an anticancer agent to the oral cavity could enable the precise delivery of cytotoxic drugs to the tumor site. In this sense, polymeric NPs with mucoadhesive properties could be an adequate choice to entrap and deliver a chemotherapeutic agent [<xref rid="B231-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. As a matrix to prepare these NPs, CS stands out as a biocompatible and biodegradable amino polysaccharide that can provide mucoadhesiveness to drug delivery systems. </p><p>Matos et al. [<xref rid="B230-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>] developed mucoadhesive CS NPs entrapping the chemotherapeutic oxaliplatin (OXPt) and evaluated ex vivo its penetration in porcine mucosa under both passive and iontophoretic topical treatments. These NPs provided a &#8220;burst effect&#8221; on the drug release followed by a longer-term controlled release. When applied to the oral mucosa, the CS NPs increased 3-fold drug penetration, and this rate was maintained even when the mucosa was &#8220;washed&#8221; with a buffer to mimic salivation. Iontophoresis doubled the amount of OXPt transported to the mucosa. These amounts exceeded the dose required to cause cell death of an oral tumor cell line. Besides, CS NPs increased the rate of cells that entered apoptosis. This study points to the feasibility of topical therapy with CS NPs, potentialized by the application of iontophoresis, to treat oral tumors.</p><p>Pornpitchanarong et al.

The Cat moiety of the NPs allowed the excellent adhesion of the carrier to the oral mucosa and sustained local delivery of DOX into the oral cavity. The modified NPs demonstrated superior mucoadhesive capability on ex vivo porcine oral mucosal tissues compared with the unmodified NPs. The DOX-loaded Cat/CS/HA NPs (DOX-Cat/CS/HA NPs) inhibited the growth of the HN22 oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line with a low IC50.

Periodontal Drug Delivery</title><p>Periodontal diseases are chronic infectious diseases and are major oral health problems [<xref rid="B232-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. They are caused by a dental plaque biofilm in the oral cavity that can lead to the progressive destruction of periodontal tissue, including the gingiva, periodontal ligament (PDL), cementum, and alveolar bone. Different approaches for treating the periodontal tissues damaged by periodontitis have been pursued including the so-called guided tissue regeneration approach (GTR). The GTR treatment involves the application of a barrier membrane between the gingival epithelium and connective tissues, which prevents migration of the epithelium and gingival connective tissue cells into the defect sites and provides a secluded space for the formation of PDL, cementum, and bone. The administration of antimicrobial agents prevents and treats bacterial periodontal infections. Controlled local delivery of antimicrobials into the defect sites presents many advantages compared to oral administration, including site-specific delivery, a decrease in dose requirement, and side effects [<xref rid="B199-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. CS has attracted considerable attention for this area owing to its special properties including antimicrobial efficacy, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity.

Dos Santos et al. [<xref rid="B200-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>] prepared core-sheath nanofibers via coaxial electrospinning by using CS with well-defined structural characteristics as the shell layer and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) containing tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) as the core layer. Defect-free and geometrically uniform nanofibers with diameters predominantly in the range of 100&#8211;300 nm were prepared. The mechanical properties as well as the stability of nonwovens in an aqueous medium were greatly improved by genipin-crosslinking, which enabled a sustained release of TH over 14 days. Results also revealed that the release profile of TH in the presence of lysozyme was affected by the composition of the shell layer, as the TH release rate increased with decreasing the degree of deacetylation (DD). Further in vitro antimicrobial activity experiments demonstrated that the cross-linked nonwovens containing TH had strong activity against bacterial strains associated with periodontal disease. Additionally, the nonwovens did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity toward fibroblast (HDFn) cells, hence, showing their potential for applications as a novel drug delivery platform for periodontitis treatment.</p><p>Another approach is to use metallic NPs possessing antimicrobial effectiveness in conjugation with polymeric NPs leading to periodontal diseases treatment of low toxicity.

They also tested the cytotoxic effect of this formulation on murine fibroblasts. CHX has improved the antibiofilm effect and reduced the cytotoxicity (at low concentrations) when conjugated to CS-coated IO NPs.

Several strategies have been developed to overcome the barrier properties and to enhance the transportation of drug molecules across the skin. In the last decades, numerous transdermal patches fabricated from polysaccharides have been reported. There has been a growing interest in using CS in transdermal formulations thanks to their biocompatibility, non-toxicity, film-forming ability, non-skin irritancy, etc. [<xref rid="B233-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. NPs have been advocated as one of the potential delivery systems which can resolve the skin permeation limitation of drugs to a great extent. Polysaccharide NPs are met with rising popularity as a transdermal drug delivery system. The CS NPs are biodegradable, biocompatible, mucoadhesive, and possess mucosal permeation enhancement properties. They can interact with the skin mucosa and fluidize the epidermal lipid and protein domains to promote transdermal drug diffusion. They also can have a synergistic therapeutic contribution for local disorders such as skin malignant melanoma and infection or systemic complications such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia [<xref rid="B205-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>].</p><p>Microwave radiation (characterized by frequencies range between 300 MHz and 300 GHz) is envisaged to mediate transdermal drug delivery through exerting the spacing of lipid architecture of stratum corneum into structureless domains in a non-thermal fashion.

Their transdermal drug delivery profiles across untreated and microwave-treated skins were examined. Both constituent materials of NPs and drug encapsulation were required to succeed in transdermal drug delivery. The drug&#8211;NPs transport was facilitated through constituent NPs and microwave fluidizing protein/lipid domains of epidermis and dermis and dermal trans-to-gauche lipid conformational changes. The microwave-induced marked changes to the skin ceramide content homogeneity. The CS NPs largely affected the palmitic acid and keratin domains.</p><p>The skin is also one of the most promising routes of administration for allergen immunotherapy due to its high prevalence of activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with immunostimulatory and migratory capacities. In vaccination, dermal cells residing in and around hair follicles are thought to be more accessible to topically applied vaccines than dermal cells in the interfollicular epidermis. Thus, it is important to deliver antigenic proteins to hair follicles to induce immune responses. Takeuchi et al. [<xref rid="B203-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>] investigated transdermal administration of poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs coated with chitosan hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride using iontophoresis for efficient drug delivery to hair follicles as a possibility of using it in allergen immunotherapy. Hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) was used as a model antigen. The results of an uptake test into dendritic cells showed that the usage of the NP carrier increased the mean fluorescence intensity by 5.6 times. An ex vivo skin accumulation study showed that when iontophoresis was applied to the NPs, the HEL concentration in mouse skin was 9.6 times higher than that without iontophoresis and 2.1 times higher than that of the HEL solution. Fluorescence microscopy images of cross-sections of mouse skin (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f031">Figure 31</xref>) confirmed that HEL was efficiently delivered to hair follicles using iontophoresis and NP carriers. In vivo percutaneous immunoreactivity study revealed that ten weeks after the initiation of the test using iontophoresis and the NP carrier, HEL-specific IgG1, and IgG2a titers were higher than those obtained by subcutaneous injection of the HEL solution.

Nanofiber-based carriers for localized delivery of chemotherapeutic agents have some additional advantages, like stability boosting of loaded chemotherapeutic agents with the maintenance of its cytotoxic property, controlled and targeted tumor delivery, low systemic side effects, and toxicity, single-dose therapy, and reducing administered dose in the formulation. The unique properties of CS-based nanofibers provide a great potential to formulate an effective topical drug delivery system. Morad et al. [<xref rid="B204-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>] formulated a nanofiber-based topical drug delivery system for colchicine. Colchicine systemic toxicity is an obstacle against the administration of systemic chemotherapy for melanoma management. Significant colchicine deposition in the skin with remarkable cytotoxicity against melanoma cell line makes it a desirable formulation to be administered as a topical or local reservoir system for neoadjuvant chemotherapy before other interventions and adjuvant therapy of tumors after surgery and, also, for other skin diseases with dose adjustment. Besides, the observed first-order release kinetic behavior through the skin could suggest the developed CS-based biocomposite nanofibers as a transdermal colchicine delivery system which improves its efficiency in systemic indications.</p></sec><sec><title>Dermal Delivery</title><p>Topical medication can avoid systemic side effects linked with conventional oral and injection administration.

Among the promising cosmeceuticals/nutraceuticals recently used for acne treatment, is nicotinamide. This drug exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and is reported to decrease sebum production. Abd-Allah et al. [<xref rid="B201-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>] prepared CS NPs and loaded the nutraceutical nicotinamide. The NPs were optimized, characterized, and clinically tested on patients suffering from acne vulgaris. The topical merits of the CS NPs were proven by their strong skin adhesion ex vivo and high nicotinamide deposition in the different skin layers (stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis) amounting to a total of 68%. When clinically tested on patients, the nicotinamide CS NPs displayed a 73% reduction in the inflammatory acne lesions compared to untreated areas, hence proving that this delivery system can be a clinically sounding option for the treatment of skin diseases.</p><p>Targeted hair follicle topical treatment is a promising alternative for androgenic alopecia using dutasteride (DUT). It clinically appears to provide better efficacy compared to finasteride but presents sexual dysfunctions related to adverse reactions when orally administered. DUT is an extremely lipophilic substance with poor aqueous solubility. It makes this molecule troublesome to be incorporated in conventional topical drug delivery systems intended for the scalp application, in which a viscous or oily residual could give an undesirable hair aspect and be rejected by the patients. Nanoscale drug delivery systems would be ideal in this case, as they could incorporate the drug in their interior but still be administered in an aqueous formulation. Furthermore, nanosystems present a natural tendency for accommodation into the follicular cavities. Ushirobira et al. [<xref rid="B202-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>] compared two strategies to further promote DUT follicular-targeted delivery: the chemical modulation of nanosystem surface properties by coating with the natural polymer CS, and the application of a massage. For this, poly-(&#949;-caprolactone)-lipid-core nanocapsules (NCs) containing DUT were developed and had their permeation profile compared to CS-coated nanocapsules (CS NCs). Both coated and non-coated NCs targeted the hair follicles compared to a drug solution. Enhanced hair follicles targeting was observed after the massage procedure, with 5- and 2-fold increases relative to the non-coated NCs and coated CS NCs, respectively. Therefore, DUT in NCs can target the follicular casts, and a simple physical stimulation can additionally enhance the drug amount accumulated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot8-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.4.8. Wound Healing</title><p>In recent years, a growing deal of attention has been attracted to develop and promoting wound healing agents. Injured skin can be infected and colonization by a diverse population of microbes, which can facilitate their access to the underlying tissues. Infection is considered a significant factor that prolongs the wound healing process. Wound dressing should protect the wound from microorganisms, provide a moist environment to hinder the wound dryness, decline the wound surface necrosis, be oxygen permeable without dehydrating the wound, plus should be comfortable, and avoid mechanical trauma. Moreover, low toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility are some remarkable criteria for a material employed for the fabrication of wound dressing. It is proved that N-acetyl glucosamine as a monomer unit of CS stimulates hemostasis, encourages cell proliferation, and subsequently accelerates wound healing. As a biocompatibility aspect, CS does not lead to adverse reactions in contact with human cells. Furthermore, by binding to red blood cells CS causes rapid blood clotting. CS is also utilized to improve the stability of the drugs by producing CS NPs and resulting in drug accumulation increment [<xref rid="B206-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. </p><p>Fahimirad et al.

The electrospraying of CUR-CS NPs on the surface of CUR-PCL/CS NFs resulted in enhanced antibacterial, antioxidant, cell proliferation efficiencies, and higher swelling and water vapor transition rates. In vivo examination and histological analysis showed CUR-PCL/CS NFs electrosprayed with CUR-PCL/CS NFs led to a significant improvement of the complete well-organized wound healing process in MRSA (methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) infected wounds. These results suggest that the application of CUR-PCL/CS NFs electrosprayed with CUR-CS NPs as a wound dressing significantly facilitates wound healing with notable antibacterial, antioxidant, and cell proliferation properties.</p><p>Antibiotic-loaded nanofibrous-delivery systems offer an advanced approach to overcome several limitations associated with antibiotic therapy; the benefits include high surface-area-to-volume ratios, high porosity, high loading capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, minimum systemic toxicity, and the possibility of controlling the release from immediate to controlled release. Antibiotic-loaded NFs can be applied topically for skin and wound healing, post-operation implants for the prevention of abdominal adhesion, and prophylaxis and treatment of infections in orthopedic surgery. Amiri et al. [<xref rid="B67-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] developed a local antibiotic delivery system using polyethylene oxide/chitosan nanofibers (PEO/CS NFs) prepared via electrospinning for delivery of teicoplanin. The PEO/CS NFs were able to release teicoplanin for up to 12 days. An antibacterial test and time-kill study on <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> also demonstrated that loading teicoplanin in the PEO/CS NFs not only kept the antibacterial activity of antibiotic but also enhanced it up to 1.5- to 2-fold. The teicoplanin-loaded NFs did not show any cytotoxicity to human fibroblast. Moreover, in vivo study on a rat full-thickness wound model confirmed the safety and efficacy of applying the teicoplanin-loaded PEO/CS NFs; a significant improvement in wound closure was observed especially with the NFs containing 4% teicoplanin. The sustained release profile, enhanced drug activity, cytocompatibility, and significant wound healing activity affirm the potential applications of the teicoplanin-loaded PEO/CS NFs in wound healing and local antibiotic delivery.</p><p>Wounds are often recalcitrant to traditional wound dressings and a bioactive and biodegradable wound dressing using hydrogel membranes can be a promising approach for wound healing applications. Shafique et al.

The results indicated the novel crosslinking and thermal stability of the fabricated hydrogel membrane. The in vitro analysis demonstrated that the developed membrane had water vapors transmission rate (WVTR) between 2000 and 2500 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day and oxygen permeability between 7 and 14 mg/L, which laid in the range of an ideal dressing.

Vaginal Drug Delivery</title><p>Vaginal delivery is very attractive for both local and systemic administration of drugs. For the latest purpose, it shows several advantages concerning conventional oral or parenteral ways, such as the avoidance of the stomach acidic pH, the hepatic first-pass effect, or the needle-based formulations uncomfortable for the patients. The vaginal mucosa is characterized by high robustness, ease of accessibility, and rich blood supply. The effectiveness of typical vaginal formulations (creams, foams, gels, tablets, films, rings, and suppositories) can be limited by their low active residence time due to the washing-effect of the vaginal physiological fluids, small absorption area, barrier properties of the mucosa, and inadequate spreading of the formulation on vaginal surfaces. Pharmaceutical nanocarriers provide several advantages such as a high surface area and great carrier capacity, improved stability of the therapeutic agents against chemical/enzymatic degradation, enhanced bioavailability, longer drug effect in the target tissue, and drug targeting upon inclusion of specific ligands. The development of NP-based vaginal drug delivery formulations has largely been focused on biological vaccine or microbicide delivery for prevention or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), or human papillomavirus (HPV). The vaginal route allows a localized delivery of peptide-based vaccines/microbicides close to both the site of infection and infectible cells. An opportune vaginal drug delivery system should provide mucosal interactions that facilitate bioadhesion with mucosa increasing drug residence time at the mucosal surface, and penetration enhancement properties to allow penetration into vaginal tissue cells. In the last years, many authors have studied the mucoadhesive and penetration enhancement properties of CS in this area [<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. </p><p>Marciello et al. [<xref rid="B210-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>] proposed a straightforward and efficient strategy for the vaginal application and release of peptide-loaded mucoadhesive CS NPs. The CS NPs, responsible for carrying the peptide drug and allowing adhesion to the vaginal mucosal epithelium, were encapsulated in suitable hydrophilic freeze-dried cylinders. The hydrophilic freeze-dried cylinders facilitated the application and quick release of the CS NPs to the vaginal zone. Upon contact with the aqueous vaginal medium, the excipients constituting these sponge-like systems were quickly dissolved enabling the release of their content. In vitro release studies showed the ability of the sponge-like systems and the CS NPs to deliver the mucoadhesive NPs and peptides, respectively. CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy) micrographs proved the CS NPs ability to promote the peptide penetration inside the vaginal mucosa.</p><p>To prime adaptive immune responses from the female reproductive tract (FRT), particulate antigens must be transported to draining lymph nodes (dLNs) since no local organized lymphoid structures are being equivalent to those found in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Therefore, it is a challenge to find how to safely and effectively navigate successive barriers to transport such as crossing the epithelium and gaining access to migratory cells and lymphatic drainage that provide entry into dLNs. Park et al. [<xref rid="B234-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>] demonstrated that an intravaginal pretreatment with CS significantly facilitated the translocation of NPs across the multilayered vaginal epithelium to target dLNs. In addition, the CS pretreatment was found to enhance the NP associations with immunogenic antigen-presenting cells in the vaginal submucosa. These observations indicate that CS may have great potential as an adjuvant for both local and systemic protective immunity against viral infections in the FRT.</p><p>Vaginal candidiasis is a common genital tract infection caused by dimorphic fungi of the genus Candida. Sustained delivery systems prepared using biodegradable polymers, such as CS, are interesting because they may promote a slow release of the drug by controlled rates of their degradation. CS itself can reduce the microbial population. Hence, a nanoparticulate system based on CS can represent an alternative and promising therapy for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Amaral et al. [<xref rid="B209-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>] fabricated polymeric NPs based on CS incorporating the common antifungal miconazole nitrate and tested them in vivo using murine vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). The treatment using the CS NPs with miconazole nitrate provided the same therapeutic efficacy as miconazole nitrate in a commercial cream formulation but using the antifungal content about seven-fold lower. In another work, Arumugam et al. [<xref rid="B211-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>] studied the killing effects of seaweed-derived metabolite Callophycin A (Cal) loaded in both chitosan (Cal-CS) and marine sponge-derived spicules (Cal-Spi) NPs. Vaginal candidiasis-induced animal model experiments confirmed that the candidicidal activity of Cal-CS NPs resulted in a significant reduction in the fungal burden of vaginal lavage. The histo-morphological alterations also evidenced that the protective role of Cal-CS NPs in the VVC model. The Cal-CS NPs could be used as an alternative strategy for the development of novel marine natural product-based topical applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot10-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.4.10. Vaccine Delivery</title><p>Vaccine refers to biological products applied to prevent or control the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases. As for nature, the vaccines may be microbes or their toxins, enzymes, human or animal serum, and cells. The emergence of vaccines has made a significant contribution to the prevention and control of diseases. However, many problems are affecting the quality of the vaccines during their preparation, storage, and administration The major hurdle associated with oral mucosal immunization is enzymatic degradation of antigen at the stomach and low uptake of antigen sampling cells through the intestine. Hence, the vaccine administered through the oral route (less through the nasal route) requires the use of NPs. Nanomaterial-encapsulated vaccines have been proved effective in the delivery of antigens to immune cells. Such encapsulation can help in promoting immune responses and represents a promising vaccine transport vehicle. In oral vaccine delivery, the main target is Peyer&#8217;s patches. Due to the nanoparticle system, the vaccine is protected from enzymatic degradation while going to the mucosal tissue and taken up by the M-cells. CS is a particularly attractive choice for vaccine delivery because of its low immunogenicity, low toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. It has been widely used for mucosal but also systemic vaccine delivery and even in the preparation of DNA mucosal vaccines [<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

Activation of macrophages occurs after the uptake of CS [<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. CS exhibited good tolerability and excellent immune stimulation. The numerous recent hepatitis A outbreaks emphasize the need for vaccination; despite the effectiveness of the current vaccination, further development is needed to overcome its high cost plus some immune response limitations. AbdelaAllah et al.

Immune responses towards the HA-AL, HA-CS, and HA-ALG/CS NPs were assessed in mice. The HA-ALG/CS NPs significantly improved the immunogenicity by increasing the seroconversion rate, the hepatitis A antibodies level, and the splenocytes proliferation. Thus, the HA-ALG/CS NPs adjuvant was superior to the other classes in IFN-&#947; (interferon-gamma) and IL-10 (interleukin 10) development. The solution formula of the HA vaccine with CS showed comparable humoral and cellular immune responses to AL-adjuvanted suspension with a balanced Th1/Th2 immune pathway. The study demonstrated the potential of the ALG-coated CS NPs as an effective carrier for an HA vaccine. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot11-ijms-22-09652"><title>3.4.11. Gene Delivery</title><p>Genes encoded specific proteins are essential for various physiological processes of the body and their mutations often result in disease. Gene therapy is a promising strategy to treat genetic diseases via the introduction of a foreign gene into a target cell which is then transcribed, and the genetic information is finally translated into the corresponding protein. The aim is to correct a damaged gene. For this process to be completed, the gene delivery system has to overcome several hurdles. The factors affecting transfection include targeting the delivery system to the target cell, uptake, and degradation in the endolysosomes, transport through the cell membrane, and intracellular transfer of plasmid DNA to the nucleus. Thus, DNA and RNA molecules can be destroyed by harsh acids and enzymes that are produced in the body. DNA and RNA are anionic polymers that have a good affinity with cationic polymers such as CS. CS can protect the DNA or RNA against nuclease degradation by forming a polyelectrolyte complex with negatively charged DNA or RNA. This protection can improve the transfection efficiency [<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>There are two main approaches for gene delivery systems, i.e., viral and nonviral ones. Considering efficiency and safety issues, polymeric vehicles would seem more convenient than other gene delivery approaches. Because of its positive charge and the small size of CS NPs (below 100 nm), endocytosis can be achieved. CS NP is therefore a promising excipient for non-viral gene delivery. In addition, chitosan&#8211;DNA-based drug complexes protect at least to some extent against degradation by DNAses in this way improving the bioavailability of DNA-based drugs delivered into the body [<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Rahmani et al. [<xref rid="B216-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>] investigated in vitro DNA transfection efficiency of three CS derivatives, namely trimethyl chitosan thiolated with cysteine (CysTMC), methylated 4-N,N-dimethyl aminobenzyl N,O carboxymethyl chitosan (MABCMC), and trimethyl aminobenzyl chitosan thiolated with cysteine (CysMABC). The results showed that all the polymers could condense DNA plasmid strongly from N/P 2 and nanocomplexes had eligible sizes and zeta potentials. Moreover, the nanocomplexes had negligible cytotoxicity and CysMABC was the most effective vehicle for gene delivery in HEK-293T cells. In the two other cell lines, SKOV-3 and MCF-7, CysTMC exhibited the highest transfection efficiency.</p><p>Among several types of non-viral vectors, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), short peptides with 30 amino acids, are promising. CPPs show high biocompatibility and offer the potential for large-scale production. However, CPPs exhibit low transfection efficiency. Hybrid conjugation of CPPs with inorganic nanomaterials improved their efficiency and may open new venues for multifunctional treatment. Abdelhamid et al. [<xref rid="B214-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>] synthesized hierarchical mesoporous carbon (MPC) nanomaterials derived from the carbonized chitosan (CTS) encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) and applied them for gene delivery. The MPC materials were applied as a non-viral vector for gene delivery using two oligonucleotides (ONs) called luciferase-expressing plasmid (pGL3), and splice correction oligonucleotides (SCO). The materials were biocompatible and showed insignificant toxicity. The MPC improved the transfection efficiency of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) (PepFect 14 (PF-14), and PF-221) by 10-fold compared to commercial vector Lipofectamine&#8482;2000 due to the synergistic effect of their action. This may be due to the positive charge of CPPs that ensure higher interactions with the negative charge of the cells.</p><p>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a double-stranded RNA of 20 to 25 nucleotides in length and has many important functions in biology. It primarily plays a unique role in the RNA interference events which regulates gene expression in a specific manner. siRNA-based therapies have great potential in the modulation of a large number of target mRNA molecule silencing, which ultimately decreased levels of the targeted protein. Nevertheless, there are challenges that applications of this gene silencing technology need to overcome, including rapid degradation of siRNA under physiological conditions and the difficulty of passing the cytoplasmic membrane of negatively charged siRNA. The key challenge in realizing the therapeutic potency of siRNA is the development and design of a novel degradable vector with safe and sufficient gene delivery efficacy. To improve the transfection efficiency, new safe vehicles for cancer gene delivery based on NPs have been developed. Recently some different modifications of CS have been used to produce these NPs, for example, a polyelectrolyte complex containing trimethyl chitosan (TMC) as the positive and, dextran sulfate, and alginate as the negative part [<xref rid="B218-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>], guanidinylated O-carboxymethyl chitosan (GOCMCS) along with poly-&#946;-amino ester (PBAE) for siRNA delivery [<xref rid="B220-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>].</p><p>Yan et al.

The results showed the FITCCS/CMC NPs could effectively encapsulate anti-&#946;-catenin siRNA through ionic gelation self-assembly to improve the stability of siRNA. The FITCCS/CMC NP-based pH-sensitive delivery system provided a controlled release of siRNA through responding to external stimulus (ultrasound) under favorable pH conditions. Following the transfection of anti-&#946;-catenin siRNA for 48 h, the &#946;-catenin protein expression of the colon cancer cells was reduced to about 40.10%, indicating the effective reduction of the protein that promotes colon cancer proliferation. </p><p>CS as a promising polysaccharide for gene/siRNA delivery requires some additional treatments to modify CS NPs. Mobarakeh et al. [<xref rid="B217-ijms-22-09652" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>] modified CS NPs to introduce anti-HIV siRNA into two mammalian cell lines, macrophage RAW264.7, and HEK293. The CS NPs were prepared by using different concentrations of CS, polyethyleneimine (PEI), and carboxymethyl dextran (CMD) in various formulations. The results indicated that the combination of CS with both CMD and PEI significantly improved both cell viability and siRNA delivery. In the studied cell types, the NPs noticeably increased siRNA delivery efficiency with no significant cytotoxicity or apoptosis-inducing effects compared to the control cells. In addition, the NPs significantly reduced the RNA and protein expression of HIV-1 tat in both stable cells.</p><p>Induction of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) as a direct consequence of oxygen deficiency in tumor tissues is a potent stimulus of CD73 (ecto-5&#8242;nucleotidase) expression. Hypoxic environment and CD73 overexpression are associated with altered metabolism, elevated cancer cell proliferation, and tumor vascularization. Hajizadeh et al.

The SPIONs were encapsulated with thiolated chitosan (TC) and trimethyl chitosan (TMC) for improving their stabilization and functionalization. The produced NPs were efficiently accumulated in the tumor site, indicating their stability and targeting ability in reaching the tumor region. TAT-conjugated TMC/TC/SPIONs containing siRNAs significantly reduced the HIF-1&#945; and CD73 expression levels in cancer cells. Moreover, siRNA-loaded NPs effectively reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis as is illustrated by CAM (cell angiogenesis) assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-09652-f033">Figure 33</xref>.

Using PD cell models, they demonstrated that pDNA-NGF-ActPP/CS NPs had good neuroprotective effects. More significantly, experiments using a mouse PD model showed that pDNA-NGF-ActPP/CS NPs could ameliorate the behavioral disorders of sick mice. Immunohistochemical and Western blot (WB) analyses revealed that pDNA-NGF-ActPP/CS NPs could significantly reverse dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss in the substantia nigra and striatum of sick mice.

Concluding Remarks</title><p>The recent review and research papers indicate CS NPs play a vital role in biomedical applications such as drug/vaccine/gene delivery, bioimaging, wound healing, tissue engineering, etc. They highlighted an outstanding position of CS as a polysaccharide able to form NPs favorable for various drug delivery purposes because of its many beneficial properties, such as mucoadhesion, controlled drug release, transfection, permeation enhancement, in situ gelation, efflux pump inhibitory properties, and stimuli-responsive properties. Many works demonstrated, via in vitro and in vivo experiments, CS NPs designed for controlled drug delivery may improve the stability of the drug and increase the efficacy of therapeutic agents. The other advantages of CS NPs DDS, presented in recent works, involved reduced therapeutical doses leading to reduced possible side effects, better bioavailability, and finally better patient compliance.</p><p>Nevertheless, the current research is still oriented towards an additional improvement of the chitosan properties. There are efforts to enhance its low solubility in physiological pH, stimuli-responsive properties, and specificity towards complex biological systems by chemical modifications of pure CS or by blending CS with other polymers or inorganic materials. In this way, new modified CS-based nanoparticles and nanocomposites possessing more or less enhanced properties were developed. Such innovative CS particulate systems provided, to a more/less extent, non-toxic, biocompatible, stable, target-specific, and biodegradable delivery devices. In addition, the systems with a proper label (e.g., metal-based nanocomposites) enabled target-specific diagnostics (due to easy dual introduction of an imaging agent together with a therapeutic agent) along with a target-specific therapy (due to a stimulus-responsive matrix). Recent newly developed native CS NPs, modified CS NPs, or CS nanocomposites were applied as potential drug carriers for many drugs and various routes of administrations. They were mainly studied for anticancer agents, proteins, vaccines, and genetic material. For example, in oral DD, new CS NPs enhanced the absorption of the drugs through the opening of tight junctions of the mucosal membrane. In ocular DD, in situ gelling properties and mucoadhesive character of CS enabled prolonging drug release. In nasal delivery, CS NPs increased the permeability of the drugs. In vaccine delivery, CS NPs enabled to formulate oral vaccines providing enhanced absorption of these hydrophilic biomolecules.</p><p>Despite apparent current progress, safety and targeting specificity are remaining among the main challenges in the future development of CS-based nanoparticulate DDSs. Therefore, systematic studies on biodistribution, in vitro and in vivo toxicity, and selectivity will further continue with newly developed CS derivatives and their NPs and nanocomposites for various administration routes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the projects APVV-15-0585, VEGA 1/0463/18, KEGA 027UK-4/2020, and the Toxicological and Antidoping Center at the Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University in Bratislava.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>The authors contributed to the manuscript equally.
