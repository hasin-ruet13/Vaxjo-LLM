Also, the text mentions that "all ACV products also contain other purified pertussis antigens such as FHA, Fim 2&3 and Prn as these antigens are considered to be important in the generation of a protective immune response" but it does not mention any adjuvants.

Note that Aluminum hydroxide and Glucopyranosyl lipid A are mentioned as adjuvants, but their mechanisms of action are not explicitly described in the text. TLR-4 agonist is also mentioned as an adjuvant, but its mechanism of action is not described.

Here is the list of vaccine adjuvants mentioned in the text along with their immune response mechanisms:

```
[
  {
    "adjuvant": "Alum",
    "immune_response_mechanism": "Activates NLRP3 inflammasome and forms a depot for slow antigen release."
  },
  {
    "adjuvant": "MPLA",
    "immune_response_mechanism": "Engages TLR4 pathway to promote Th1 responses."
  },
  {
    "adjuvant": "α-GalCer",
    "immune_response_mechanism": "Strongly enhances antigen-specific antibody responses following oral coadministration with Dukoral® in a mice model."
  }
]
```

Note: α-GalCer is mentioned in the context of being an effective inducer of natural killer T cells (NKT) and an adjuvant to elicit T-cell immune response to viruses, but its exact immune response mechanism is not explicitly described in the text.

Here is the list of vaccine adjuvants mentioned in the text:

```
[
  {
    "adjuvant": "Alum",
    "immune_response_mechanism": "Toll-like receptor agonist complexed with aluminum"
  },
  {
    "adjuvant": "AS03",
    "immune_response_mechanism": "α-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate 80 in an oil-in-water emulsion"
  },
  {
    "adjuvant": "CpG",
    "immune_response_mechanism": "Toll-like receptor agonist complexed with aluminum"
  }
]
```

Note: CpG and AS03 are adjuvants, but Alum is mentioned as a complexed form with CpG, and AS03 is mentioned as a formulation containing α-tocopherol, squalene, and polysorbate 80. However, for the purpose of this task, they are all considered adjuvants.

  },
  {
    "adjuvant": "Sigma Adjuvant System",
    "immune_response_mechanism": "Not explicitly described"
  }
]
```

Note that some of the adjuvants have mechanisms of action described in the text, but this information is not explicitly stated for all of them.
