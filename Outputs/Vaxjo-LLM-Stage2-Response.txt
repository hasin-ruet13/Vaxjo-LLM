You are an expert immunologist and biomedical research assistant.
TASK: Analyze the provided text on a vaccine adjuvant's immune response. Extract and structure the key mechanistic information according to the specified JSON schema.

## Instructions for the "summary" field:
- **Synthesize the information into a cohesive, mechanistic narrative of approximately 3-5 sentences.**
- This summary should not be a simple list of facts. Instead, it should describe the sequence of immunological events initiated by the adjuvant.
- For example, describe how the adjuvant is initially sensed (e.g., by PRRs like TLRs), how this leads to innate cell activation (e.g., dendritic cells), and how this subsequently shapes the adaptive response (e.g., T cell polarization and antibody production).
- Integrate the corresponding PMIDs directly into the text immediately following the claims they support.

## Instructions for the "mechanism_subtypes" field:
- Identify **every distinct** immunological mechanism.
- For each identified subtype, list all unique PMIDs cited as evidence for it in the source text.
- Do not merge related subtypes; for example, if both "dendritic cell" and "TLR4" are mentioned, create separate entries for each.

## General Rules:
- **Strict JSON Output:** The entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with no surrounding text or explanations.
- **Source Adherence:** Use ONLY the information and PMIDs present in the provided text. Do not infer or add external knowledge.

## JSON Schema:

This results in a dose-dependent elevation of both innate and adaptive immunity, ultimately augmenting protection via the induction of a Th1-mediated antibody response. The engagement of the TLR4 pathway promotes the generation of cytokine-producing T helper 1 cells, germinal center B cells, and long-lived bone marrow plasma cells, leading to strong humoral and cellular immune responses.

The successful delivery of immune stimulatory molecules by GC enables the activation of T cell responses, including CD8+ T cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity, and the production of tumor-specific antibodies.

  "summary": "Upon recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as TLRs, the adjuvant VSA-2 triggers the activation of innate immune cells, including dendritic cells, which then migrate to lymphoid organs and present antigens to T cells. This leads to the polarization of T cells, with a shift towards Th1 or Th2 responses, ultimately resulting in the production of specific antibodies and cellular immune responses. The subsequent immune response is modulated by the cytokine environment, which is influenced by the adjuvant-induced activation of immune cells.",
